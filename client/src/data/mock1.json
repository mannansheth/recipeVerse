This is an updated review by DreamoBway. She has an excellent other use for this dough --- UPDATE from DreamoBway: &quot;I tried making these in mini muffin tins, hollowed out a little well, and filled them with pecan tassy filling. I also upped the cooking temp to 350 and they browned beautifully. It was a successful experiment! \r\nUPDATE(12\/15\/09) new use for cookies from ukichix -&quot; I think this would work well as a GF crumb crust... bake 1 large cookie in a 8x8 pan, then &quot;crumb&quot; it up, add some cornflake crumbs and prepare a crumb base. I will try and repost the results! revision: pressed the entire recipe into a 9x13 pan and baked for 30 mins (until golden on the edges), let cool - and &quot;crumbed&quot;. Used 1\/2 of these crumbs and 1\/2 cornflake crumbs, with some sugar and melted butter to prepare a GF like Graham Cracker Crust with was sweet and soft. Perfect for Crumb Crust desserts.&quot;",

            "4. While muffins are baking, place 1\/4 cup of melted margarine in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together 1\/2 cup of sugar with the cinnamon. Remove muffins from their cups, dip each muffin in the melted margarine, and roll in the sugar-cinnamon mixture. Let cool and serve.",
            "My Note:   I was curious about a couple of things about this recipe. First, why did I end up with 24, not 12, of these mini muffins as the recipe indicates? Could it be that I  misprint? Mine is a standard, mini-muffin tin. Second, I really don't like nutmeg much. So WHY do I LOVE these muffins?! And why can't I stop popping them in my mouth? Don't kid yourself by thinking that because they're small you won't eat as much. You'll just eat more of them. And making them in the mini muffin tins was GENIUS, Dianne! That way you get more of that buttery, cinnamony sweetness in every bite! I did make a couple of modifications, but nothing that would significantly alter the recipe. I used butter instead of margarine and, because I have an entire quart of buttermilk to use, I subbed buttermilk for the milk. This worked beautifully, but please note that if you do that you MUST add 1\/2 teaspoons baking soda and eliminate the baking powder to adjust the acidity and make them rise properly! Plus they're so darned pretty I could just eat them up! (And I already did, with five of them] Your recipe is a beauty, Dianne! ~A hopefully helpful update: because of my curiosity I did some shopping around to learn that the sizes of mini-muffin tins varies, sometimes significantly! This explains the variance in yield with this recipe, to anywhere from 12 to 24 of these little muffins. This recipe makes 24 mini muffins. You fill the muffins cups 1\/2 full with batter, and they should rise to just above top of the muffin tin. You can certainly also make 12 larger mini muffins if you wish, but \"officially\" this recipe makes 24. I think 12 has worked for me because my muffin tin is on the bigger side. Sorry about the confusion!",
            "I dare you to eat just one --  With that in mind the only thing I would do differently next time is to double or triple the recipe because these don't last long. I sprayed a little Pam for baking in the bottom of my mini-muffin cups so they'd pop right out. I can't wait to make these with my niece as this is definitely a kid friendly recipe.",
            "I put in a little less than 1\/2 tsp of nutmeg. I also coated mine in powdered sugar, vanilla glaze and a chocolate glaze. We all like the vanilla glaze best! Here is the recipe I used for my vanilla glaze 2 cups confectioners' sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 TBS milk 1 TBS butter, softened Put that into a bowl and mix together. I added more milk, but I didn't measure. I just got it to the consistancy I liked. Once I mixed it, I poured have of the glaze into another bowl and added 1 TBS cocoa powder and mixed. Then I dipped the muffins in the glazes and let dry. I double dipped them. Then on the vanilla glaze ones, I dipped some of the tops in the chocolate glaze. Also, glaze them once they have cooled. If you don't wait, they will fall apart."

Since it is a plain cheesecake I put cherry pie filling, strawberry pie filling and caramel sauce to the side in different bowls so they could put on top whatever they wanted or you can put on top whatever you prefer.

In the south of Portugal the meat is cooked directly in the marinade (like this recipe) while some cooks in the north like to marinate the pork up to 2 days then cook it on a rack.  Sometimes they slide a tray of cooked rice underneath the roast to catch the juices (the rice will have a strong flavor, not to everyone's taste).  Please do not be tempted to use a more expensive cut, such as tenderloin, because it will not have the marbling necessary to keep the meat moist during the long cooking time.   Serve with plain boiled potatoes and Portuguese hard rolls to soak up the pan juices.",

My FIRST recipe post to the site, This recipe was given to me by my mom, I have NO idea where she got it, but it is just awesome, simple to make, and it is the ONLY fish my picky, picky 11 year old daughter will eat, she loves it! She actually BEGS me to make it. Update: After reading the reviews, I just want to emphasize the importance of using Panko breadcrumbs in this recipe. It makes a HUGE difference! I also have never baked this fish, so cannot predict the results. For those who have commented that the breading isn't sticking well, I have found that this happens to me as well, when I have used too much of the mustard\/mayo combo. A thin coating is best! I hope you all enjoy this recipe, and thanks for taking the time to review it!",

We had them as part of a moderate meal with baguette slices and a simple salad. If you make many smaller versions, you could serve them as appetizers.",

        "Description":"This recipe for Prime Rib works every time, thus the word &quot;magic.&quot; I have relied on it for holiday dinners and special occasion meals for over 25 years. It really gives the chef a lot of wiggle room to make the rest of the meal. It does take 2 1\/2 hours of oven time. And it does work! I have the butcher debone then retie it for the best flavor. I have had good luck with this method of cooking for many years with 3-5 pound roasts, but several chefs here at Zaar have said that the roast should be 5-7 plus. Just always go to the butcher and order Prime or get Choice. None of this &quot;Select&quot; or &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; stuff. If you're spending the money for a prime rib roast, please don't go for these cheap and flavorless grades of meat. We learned this the hard way and should have known better, Hubby's Daddy was a butcher. And they are a dying breed. I hope you enjoy this cooking method and the results!",

        "Description":"Based on a recipe from the July 2003 issue of Bon Appetit, and is its cover photo. Robb Walsh is the author of Legends of Texas Barbecue Cookbook, and is based in Houston, Texas. The intro says, &quot;Want to cook like a real Texas cowboy? This is the recipe for you. Adapted from a method found at Cooper's Old Time Pit Bar-B-Que in the Hill Country town of Llano, Walsh's homage to the range involves grilling the meat over mesquite coals and chips. The result is a profound experience in smoky flavor -- and history. 'Mesquite grows as thorny scrub all over Texas....It's basically a nuisance, so cooks are happy to use it for grilling and smoking.'&quot; Further, &quot;Those with Texas-size appetites will require an entire steak; for most others -- even the heartiest of meat lovers -- half of one of these rib steaks is probably plenty.&quot; Naturally, my DH loves this recipe! :) Prep time includes the 30 minutes to soak the mesquite or hickory wood smoke chips and the one hour standing time.",

I grabbed a couple of cans of it, figuring that I could come up with a recipe to use one of them them in. Even though there is some beef in the soup, I still used it with hamburger. This is very easy to make. It's more like a Stroganoff without added mushrooms. I am allergic to black pepper, so I don't add it to my recipes. Use however much you want to. You can use more onion and garlic if you want to. Prep time and cook time are appx.",

Each gives the sauce a slightly different flavor and I like them all. Just not all at the same time. same thing for the sugar and\/or molasses. I find the cider vinegar works well with the molasses while the red or white vinegar works best with white or brown sugar. but thats just my opinion. Sometime I use the brown sugar and molasses at the same time which gives it a more sweet less spicy version. Be aware that as the sauce sits overnight the spices will mature and get hotter. The sauce usually fully matures after 48 hours. It can be used right away just be warned about tomorrow if you get a little excited with the peppers.",

When onions are slowly cooked, the natural sugars begin to caramelize and bring out a delicious richness that is so savory. Add in a little pastry and creamy base and voila, we have a french onion tart. Serve as an appetizer or perfect for lunch with a simple salad. The perfect new addition to my Easter table. Elegant yet so simple!",

        "Description":"This is such a delicious recipe that does NOT translate well into English. I've seen translations of &quot;cake-like fried milk balls in scented syrup&quot; and seen people scratch their heads and go..what? Well, bear with the translations here, there's not too much of a western equivalency that I can think of. The name literally is gulab meaning rose and jamun- the only thing I can think of is a round fruit of the same name. (If anyone knows better let me know!) The synopsis...milk is boiled down into a thick, fudge-like consistency and mixed with the slightest bit of flour to form a dough, formed into balls, fried slowly in ghee (butter oil) and then when golden, put to soak in rose-scented sugar syrup. Wow! What's not to love? The consistency of the balls are tender and delicious, almost half cheese, half custard. You'll have to try and describe for yourself. I'm giving two methods for making the dough..the longer, traditional method and the easier, faster, thank-you-for-powdered-milk method. I'm also including a how-to for ghee, since frying the jamuns in ghee makes such a difference in taste. Oil...bleh :(      Note: Work time is for the powdered-milk method and does not include ghee if you have to make it, which usually takes around 20 minutes. Also, does not include soak time.",

            "To Make Ghee: Put the butter in a good saucepan and bring to a boil on medium heat. Then reduce to low. Now this is what will happen as the butter slowly simmers. Moisture will be evaporated out of the ghee. The white protein-solids from the butter will sink down to the bottom of the pan and slowly turn golden. A foam will rise to the surface, and as it cooks will form a bit of a crust. The butter will cook into a gold color as well, and it will have a slightly nutty smell. When the moisture is gone, the ghee is done. Decant the oil and save the delicious golden buttery bits on the bottom of the pan for toast, or mixed with veggies or potatoes. If you've used salted butter, you don't want to use it on toast- the salt will knock you out, but it's still good in potatoes or whatnot.",
            "Making the Scented Syrup: Combine sugar and water and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add rose water or essence.",
            "Traditional Method: Use a heavy-bottomed pan because the milk will stick. Use a non-stick pot if you have it. Boil the milk down over medium heat, while stirring,  until it forms a paste.  Add the flour and mix into a smooth paste. Oil your hands and roll them into uniform balls, place them onto a buttered plate and set aside.",
            "Powdered-Milk Method: Combine the warm milk and ghee together. Mix the powdered milk and flour together and sprinkle slowly into the wet mix to form a dough. Oil your hands and form uniform balls (about 24] and set aside on a buttered plate.",
            "Cooking the jamuns:",
            "This is the most delicate part of the operation. Gentle, low heat is a must. Use a wok or karai for best results, with the ghee about 2.5-3 inches in depth.",
            "Heat the ghee on low to 215 degrees.",
            "Slip in the balls, one by one. They will sink. No touching at this point.",
            "Gently shake the pan to move the balls and keep them from getting too brown on one side. After about 5 minutes they will begin to float. You will notice them getting bigger.",
            "Now, use a wooden spoon or equivalent to gently agitate and keep them evenly browning.",
            "The ghee will slowly get hotter as the balls cook.",
            "After about 20 minutes, the ghee will have risen in temperature to around 245 degrees and the balls should be nice and golden.",
            "Remove a ball and put it in the syrup. If it doesn't collapse after 3 minutes, remove the others and add to the syrup.",
            "If it does collapse, fry for another 5 minutes and try again.",

You must use the dried, sliced garlic and \"French's\" Fried onions or Hanh Phi (oriental Fried Red Onions) to get the crunch. Left overs would make delicious patties. This is so easy and IMHO very good",
