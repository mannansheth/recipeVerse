I would have liked some of the other flavors to surface.  I think by cutting the dijon back a bit it really would be a terrific dip.  Thanks Ducky! ",

Instead of using the blender I cooked all the ingredients that were to go in the blender and then used my hand immersion blender, so there was less to clean up. I did not have green beans so I just added  a little bit of pasta. My 16 year old son came home and ate the entire pot. I also used \"Recipe #289198\" for the southwest seasoning. Thank you for posting this great soup recipe.",

My only complaints are they are rather thin (only about 1/2\" thick once baked), so I may try putting the whole recipe in an 8\" pan next time and see how that goes. Also, their finished appearance is rather bland, so I will try to think of some type of topping that will up the \"wow\" factor without taking away from the flavor. Frosting would be too much, but maybe a sprinkle of icing sugar or a drizzle of caramel sauce...MMMM!  Update...baking this full recipe in an 8\" pan is NOT the way to go...you end up with VERY tall sides, but the center is still so thin.  I tried the icing sugar sprinkle and was impressed with the visual results.",

      "Review": "These are really yummy, although I must say that I'm am more of a \"brownie\" girl.  Usually blondies are too sweet for me, but these were really good.  Instead of sweetened coconut and pecans, I used unsweetened shredded coconut (can buy at international grocery stores) and semisweet chocolate chips.  These are chewy and moist.  My husband ate two right out of the oven. (Cut them with a plastic knife so we didn't have to wait! :) )  When I'm in the mood for \"Blondies\" again, I'll be making these.",

It made a beautiful, big fluffy brown loaf with little red flecks of pepperoni throughout. I didn't have any provolone, so I substituted 1/4 c. parmesan--also used olive oil in place of margarine. Oh, and I substituted 1 c. white whole wheat flour for one of the cups of flour, and used regular bread flour for the rest. The taste is fantastic! I was worried my kids wouldn't eat it, but they both gobbled it up. thanks for the recipe! I'll be making it again.",

      "Review": "This is such a hard review for me.  I made this several months ago to take to someone else so I never tried it.  I got rave reviews.  Then I made it for a BBQ today and reviews were really only so so.  Actually, others said they liked it a lot but didn't eat a lot (except DH who loves lemon and bacon and couldn't get enough).  I actually didn't care much for it.  It just seemed too tart.  I'm thinking that maybe using mayo instead of miracle whip might mellow the flavor for me a bit.",

      "Review": "YUMMY!  This was excellent.  I made some modifications due to what I had on hand when I made this.  I used Miracle Whip and eliminated the sugar.  I also only used about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of lemon juice as 1/4 cup seemed like a lot.  I  used a yellow onion in place of the green onion, and grape tomatos (cut in half).  I only had rigatoni on hand, so that's what I used.  I decided to slice up some lettuce and and serve it along side the pasta on a separate dish so you could just top the pasta with the lettuce.  I was afraid it would become soggy if mixed in with the pasta.  I served over Memorial Weekend to my husband's family and EVERYONE loved it, and many asked for the recipe.  I've been looking for a pasta salad to make other than my traditional italian pepperoni salad AND this was perfect.  Will make again and again!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.",

I think it was creamier w/o as much lettuce. I like the lettuce mixed in.  I also added 2 PACKAGES of real bacon bits, not the ones in the glass jar, the small yellow packages. It is even good the 3rd day.  I do not eat much pasta but I got raves from my family and I really ate a lot!  This is a great, easy recipe.It is one that is great for picnics or anytime.  Bacon lovers will love it as I do!!!  Mary",

I doubled the recipe and made it for my son's birthday party and wouldn't you know it...when it came time to eat I forgot to put the pasta salad out! So, my guests got to take some home with them, I had a yummy midnight snack and we had it for lunch again today! I used Miracle Whip, beef boullion, quartered cherry tomatoes for ease, and used the premade fresh bacon crumbles in the yellow. This is a no fail recipe and you will have people asking you how you made it! Wonderful!! Thanks so much!!!",

With all the jusice from the tomato and the amount of dressing involved, it actually took nicely to 12 oz of pasta instead of 7.  I imagine that 7 would actually be too little for all the sauce this makes.  I added extra bacon, and only put lettuce when it was ready to be served so that it wouldn't get soggy.

This is so tasty, my DH loved it.  I let it chill overnight and the flavors blended perfectly. The lettuce gets a bit soggy, but it really doesn't effect the taste of the salad at all.  I was so please with this recipe, and can't wait to bring it to the party, where I am sure everyone will enjoy it as much as we did!  Thanks for sharing.",

I only had a bouillon cube, so next time I will but the ground bouillon. I tried to mash the cube up well, but every once and a while I would taste a chunk of it. Yuck! I only used a cup of lettuce and next time I will use more. I thought this recipe tasted just like a BLT! With some revisions, I will definatly make this again.",

I used fresh lemon juice and added bit by bit to taste, the dressing was perfect as written but I added 1 tbs of grain mustard, just cos I like it! I made the bacon really crispy and ripped it into 1in pieces. I used the freshest crispiest lettuce I could find and this held up very well overnight, not soggy at all. My mum took it to work the next day and had to fight her colleagues to keep it! They have since all asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper, will be making this for lunches and buffets etc for a long long time! Thank you!",

I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon and it was probably just as good. Good tip with putting the lettuce at the end when it's ready to serve. It was nice a crispy and my boyfriend loved it. So did I. This will definitely impress the guests! Thanks for the recipe!!",

Cube chicken bouillon disolves really fast in the lemon juice.  Tried making subs the 2nd time around, but the original recipe is so much better!  Lasts about 2 days for 2 people.  Nicely filling.  Either a nice lunch or a nice snack.",

Instead of mixing the lettuce into the salad I just placed it on the plate and then put the salad on top of it.  Served it with garlic bread and it made for a wonderful summer night dinner.  Sure glad you found this recipe Laura36 and thanks so much for sharing :)",

      "Review": "Awesome easy recipe!  I was wanting a pasta salad and am glad I finally tried this one.  \r\nI used a big spiral tube pasta and a bit more bacon than the recipe called for and followed everything else as posted.  I was also leary about the addition of so much lemon juice and chicken bouillon but it really made a nice dressing.  I had chicken soup base I used and added some fresh black pepper.  I added extra sweet grape tomatoes, sliced diagonally w/ the seeds squeezed out.  I'm cooking for one so I didn't add the chopped romaine hearts to the pasta, I just kept everything separate until I was ready to assemble for a meal, then I tossed it together.  This will be an old standby for me--everything just blends so well.   I'm also going to try it with the brown sugar baked bacon I use for sandwiches sometimes.   The pasta does absorb most of the dressing while stored and to me was still terrific but you could mix in a bit more mayo to get the creamy consistancy if necessary later.  \r\nThanks so much!  LOVE THIS!!!",

Because of the recent tomato scare, for each batch I used a 15 oz. can of drained, diced tomatoes instead.  And I've  never served the lettuce with it.  This has been a big hit with almost everyone, even rather picky children.",

      "Review": "Excellent pasta salad. When I came across the recipe, yesterday, I knew it was dinner. Today I'm serving the left over, as a side dish, with smoked pork. I did not mix the lettuce into the salad but chose to serve it on a bed of romaine with a crusty bread. I did personalize to taste. I used 10 oz pasta insted of 7, added more bacon, actually alot more,  and used 1/2 cup light mayo with 1/2 cup light sour cream. Had to lighten it, a little, because of the extra bacon. Also several cranks of coarse fresh pepper.  Hubby added chipotle in adobo for an extra kick. The salad dressing is delicious! Planning  on making it with just sour cream for baked potatoes!!!  Thanks for sharing.",

I used Hendrickson's (St. Louis brand sweet italian) for the sweetness and pomegranate balsamic vinegar for the tartness. The color was off, but the taste was great. The mixture of ingredients is wonderful. I put the mixture over the lettuce. A real party in my mouth. Thanks so much for this one.",

I have to admit I was a little leary about making this dish as it didn't sound like an amazing combination of ingredients but I thought I would give it a try judging from the reviews. I will definitely make this dish again and again. My husband loved it and he typically doesn't like pasta salad dishes. He even suggested adding other things to the dish such as boiled eggs or tuna or chicken to add a bit more protein since we had it as our main meal for dinner. I'm sure the next time I make it I will try to add my own touches now that I know how great the recipe is on its own.",

This allowed the pasta to absorb much of the dressing.  I then added thin ribbons of heart of romaine.  We had leftovers last night (was 4 days old at this point) and it tasted even better after all the flavors continued to meld.  My lettuce hadn't broken down, and was still crisp.  Perhaps because I used romaine?  Or, because I allowed the pasta to absorb much of the dressing so it wasn't quite as wet?  Don't know, but this is good!",

That just added another layer of flavor.  Yum!",

I think this salad would lend itself easily to adding other ingredients (avocado, etc.) that one might have on hand and need to use up. Added lettuce at the last minute as some suggested.",

Such a nice change from the standard Italian dressing kind of pasta salads. This goes on the make and make again list! I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream (full fat, both!).

      "Review": "Everyone LOVED this!!  I got nervous after adding the lemon juice.  I made the dressing a few hours in advance of serving - to chill, and didn't like the taste of it AT ALL.  I thought I had made a big mistake - but it actually ended up mellowing out and you couldn't taste it.  I used cheese tortellini for the pasta and actually chopped up a couple of avacodo's and threw in.  Will hold on to this recipe and make many more times!!",

      "Review": "i, too, used half mayo and half sour cream (both half fat), mostly because i was almost out of mayo. if i'd thought of it i'd have used the homemade yogurt but oh well. i'm a vegetarian and couldn't find simulated bacon bits around here for anything right now so i did a C-L-T and used cubed cheddar instead. next time if i can't find fackon bits i might try vegetarian ham slices. i did add about a tsp of liquid smoke to the dressing for more flavor and that was a GREAT addition! fyi, 7oz of dry pasta is about half a box of smart pasta, which was plenty. i had to use a vegetarian chicken bouillon cube crumbled up as fine as i could get it since the vegetarian versions don't come in powder form. i was concerned about the small lumps that remained no matter what i did but it blended fine once on the salad. i wish i'd thought to grab some fresh lettuce from the garden instead of the tasteless iceburg in the fridge but oh well. this turned out lovely, flavorful, mild, and filling. will certainly make again! i've got the leftovers packaged with the lettuce separate for lunch tomorrow so we'll see how that goes.",

      "Review": "This is so delicious, I was having a barbecue chicken for dinner and just wanted something to go alongside and this sounded perfect. I was planning on getting the bacon but in the supermarket alongside the chicken were small packets of hot cooked ham slices that were reduced for a quick sale so that saved me some extra time and I used that.<br/>I used tricolour pasta shapes which gave it a bit of colour. Easy to follow directions with a great result.<br/>I used the leftovers for lunch the next day and added some of the remaining cold chicken.<br/>Delicious!",

I look forward to maybe adding different salad dressings with different veggies. Hmmmm HMMMMM Good. On top of that, its less that ten bucks to make a big batch. Great Salad for picnics.",

The lemon gave it the right amount of tang and cut the creaminess of the mayo nicely, as well as the salt from the bacon.  I did up the rotini just a tad because I had a little bit extra in my pantry.  Also, I put in a full pound of bacon...because well, we just love bacon.  My father has never really liked pasta salad but I saw him go back to it twice.  Everyone said this was a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!",

When I made, it tasted like it had too much dressing so I added some more pasta.  As it sat to cool for a few hours, it tasted a little bland so I had to whip up some more dressing to add to it. Had I followed the recipe exactly, probably would've worked fine. I had it both with and without the lettuce - not sure the lettuce really added to it though.",

These account for the fair rating. I was really hesitant to add them but my daughter wanted to make it exactly as it was so I conceded.Of course it was sweet & tangy which I didn't care for.

One girl said she wanted me to adopt her so I could make this for her every day!  I guess it's a winner!!",

      "Review": "This was an amazing salad! I made it exactly as the recipe said, except I used real lemon juice and abt a TBL of lemon zest. This actually made wayyy too much salad for just my husband and me, so on day TWO I minced a couple cloves of garlic, chopped a stalk of celery sauted them in a bit of butter and added it to the pasta. Then, on day THREE I deboned some grilled [leftover] chicken and tossed it into the salad with a handful of fresh lettuce and tomatoes. The salad is so good and easy to manipulate for what you have on hand. The lemon is sooo refreshing! Thanks for sharing your recipe, LAURA36 !",

At first I was worried when I saw the amount of lemon  juice, that it would be sour, so I did add maybe an extra tbsp of sugar.  But, once it's all put together it is delicious.  Even my kids, who are sometimes picky, loved it.  Definately will save this recipe to make again...Thanks!",

I added a little more bacon to the recipe and used a 12 oz box of pasta as one reviewer recommended.  Since my family prefers Spinach, am substituting this for lettuce.  I plan to add the spinach just before serving.  Nice twist to turn a pasta salad into something a little more.",

It mellows out.  I added chopped celery about 3/4 cup sliced.  Take the meat out of the tomatoes if they are large, and juicey.  I used cherry tomatoes.  Use 1/2 the dressing and let the salad marinate and chill well, then add more dressing if needed. I also used the dressing on mixed green salad with cold sliced ham or chicken on top.  It was very good.",

Substituted Better Than Bouillon 2 t. for the granules which I whisked well into the mayo so it dissolved. Also subbed 7 oz of cherry tomatoes (yes I weighed them) which is the equivalent of one large tomato. Added 3/4 cup of diced celery as recommended by another reviewer. I also used only the 7 oz of pasta even though I was tempted to add more since the rotini came in a 1 lb box (again, I weighed it for precise measurements). This recipe will go into my regular rotation and next time I would double the recipe...it only made 3-4 dinner sized portions. Great recipe...thanks!",

The next batch I melted the butter like you said and it mixed wonderfully well together! This mix is so easy to do! I do not have a sifter so I just 'sifted' the ingredients through a fine mesh metal strainer into a bowl. Worked like a charm! I made this up so that I could use it to more easily make several different kinds of cookies to send to a soldier in Iraq! My family and friends were keep me baking because they keep eating them as fast as I could get them out of the oven! I finally got smart and made all the dough 'balls' at the same time and HID some in the freezer! hehehe They never thought to look there! They froze very well giving me both mix to whip up any time and frozen dough that I can just pop on a baking sheet! Fantastic! Thanks for an amazing mix Tish!",

      "Review": "Extremely good recipe and a nice presentation change!  I made these 2 weeks prior to Thanksgiving, vacuumed sealed, and froze in the freezer.  Took out of the freezer Thanksgiving morning, placed into a muffin pan and baked as directed adding about 10 minutes extra in the oven.  Everyone raved how good these were and how cute they looked as compared to having the regular old mashed potatoes in one big pan.  Thanks Tracy for a new family standard potato for the holidays.  Will be making again for Christmas brunch for DH's family.",

It was alot easier then I thought and it turned out great! not too sweet but very tasty, everyone loved it! I used both types of nuts, mixed white n' brown sugar, and added 1/4 tsp of vanilla. A keeper for sure. Thankyou soooo much!",

      "Review": "Made these a week ago for a party this weekend. They froze well and I put them in the fridge the night before, then took them out to bring to room temp. I used splenda, whole wheat flour, almond extract (to get the nut taste - I should have used black walnut or hazelnut instead) and homemade marshmallow creme (made from splenda and significantly lower in carbs and calories - I'll post the recipe soon). I cut them into triangles and they tasted delish! Because of the splenda, these babies were done in 15 minutes, but mine came out slightly dry (I tend to overbake even when testing with toothpicks!), I suggest trying at 12, 13 minutes if using a sub. However, I don't see how these brownies are \"rocky\" - there aren't any nuts in it - that's why I added a nut-flavored extract. These should be called \"Smooth Road Brownies\" or Un-Rocky Road Brownies\"",

When I was mixing  the Fluff with the egg mixture is was quite lumpy. I beat the daylights out of it and the lumps remained. I was a little worried about it, but when I mixed it with the dry ingredients, the Fluff lumps disapeared. So don't worry about the lumps if you make this. I topped the brownies with vanilla ice cream and we loved them! The kids never suspected they were light.Thank you GB!",

Not too dry. Although I typically always follow a recipe to the tee the first time I ever make it, I had no choice but to alter this one slightly, due to not having all the ingredients required. I didn't have butter flavored Crisco, so I used plain. In additon to this, I added 2 tablespoons of butter, so I could create the butter flavor that the Crisco would have given it. I also don't have a 9\" springform pan, only a 10\" which worked perfect! I love this cake. Other fruit options I think would try are: cherries, pineapples or even pears! Thanks again!!",

It was crumbly and didn't hold together well, but the flavor was so good I wanted to  try it again. I knew it was my fault.

I borrowed from other reviewers, subbing half the butter with applesauce, adding 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract, using pistachios, plus adding some chocolate chips. We don't like things too sweet, so this was perfect for us. If you like things sweeter, you might want to increase the sugar by 1/4 cup. This definitely is not dry, and does not need any butter spread on it! This makes a large loaf, and did need about an hour for the baking time in (our newish) oven. This hit the spot perfectly!!",

I didn't have buttermilk so I used powdered milk from the fridge & vinegar & followed the rest of the recipe as written & added 1 tsp vanilla. I used my reg sized loaf pan, but it started over-flowing so I put a tray under to catch the spill. It was a litte dry, but the taste was fine, although I will add choc chips next time for a stronger chocolate flavor. It has more of a cake texture, but mine falls into fine crumbs. One good thing came from it spilling, the batter cooked to a crunchier texture than the loaf & I really liked it better than the bread. I will use the batter to make drop cookies next time. Very versatile, thanks for posting. I also wanted to say that I really appreciate the time everyone takes to review the recipes & how you altered the recipe & how it turned out.

I glanced at the recipe, saw I was missing the nuts & decided to make it w/o them. I prepared the wet + dry ingredients & then chastised myself for having forgotten the banana. Why? you might ask & the honest answer is I thot I was making choc banana bread! Since all else was ready to go, I added my 3 bananas & made 3 mini loaves of some damn fine choc banana bread. Thx for sharing your recipe w/us. This success story never would have happened w/o it & next time I'll be sure to have the nuts on hand .. along w/the bananas. Yum! :-)",

These changes reduced the calories to 185 cal per serving. The flavour and texture was just fantastic and I am sure this loaf won't survive long. I will be making this lots! Made for your Cook A Thon (PS - the kids   friends just came asking for seconds.....)",

Best of all it is not overly sweet. I used Dutch cocoa powder, and toasted slivered almonds. I will try toasted pecans next time I make this. Thanks for sharing this recipe Sharon. It was definitely enjoyed by all. Made and reviewed for the Best of 2010 Recipe Tag Game.",

I also added some more ground cloves for that extra zing. This tastes great with dollops of chilled plain yogurt on the top! Thanks Sharon... this recipe is definitely a keeper!",

I used dried apricots for the raisins (only because I like them better) and totally forgot to add the peas! The cinnamon, clove and cumin were very nice but I think they could be increased in amount. That might not be the case if I had the lentils. Even with all of my botching this was still a very flavorful and pleasing dish. Sharon, I'll make it again when the lentils come home!",

      "Review": "This is the easiest dog treat ever, and the best!  I've tried many recipes and store-bought treats, but these are far and away Jake's favorite.  (He will do anything for one! :) )The dough is so easy to work with, too.  Any other recipe I've tried has been so crumbly and hard to shape, but not this one.  If I were to suggest anything, it would be to store these in the refrigerator.  In the summer humidity these got a little warm and fuzzy at room temperature, but lasted a long time in the fridge.  Thank you so much for this recipe!",

Only baked them for 12 minutes, until they were firm but not really hard like a dog biscut.  Two of my four dogs don't care for that type of treat (hard and crunchy) and the other two don't care.  That said, I have four dachshunds that LOVE THESE!!!  After the first taste test, they just hung around everytime I took the next batch out of the oven.  A definite keeper.

Last night was for company, served with bbq chicken -- everyone loved it. I made it about noon and let it sit on the counter (covered) all day. Gave the wonderful marinade time to really infuse the beans & potatoes. Just a note: there is quite a bit of dressing. You could probably cut at least 1/4 of the amounts and still be fine. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I didn't have red wine vinegar but balsamic substituted nicely.  There was definitely an excess of dressing as others have mentioned.  Next time I'll put a bit less vinegar & oil.

First time I made it, it was for a dinner party at my house; I needed dishes that would serve vegetarians, and that wouldn't go bad if I left it out for hours. This fit both bills nicely! Only problem was that the first time I made it, it was definitely 'soupy', so I doubled the potatoes, and it was fine. Tonight I made it again, halved the dressing, doubled the mustard (I used super-spicy for extra kick!) and it won even MORE rave reviews. Thanks for the excellent recipe, I'll be making this one often. ",

As was suggested by others, I halved the oil and vinegar but added the other dressing ingredients in the full quantities as listed. To the dressing I also added half a teaspoon of sugar.

There is a generous proportion of dressing, but it doesn't make it taste stronger; there's just a bit extra left on your plate for your bread, which we prefer anyway.  We omitted the onions because some of us don't like them; but they weren't missed even by those who would've eaten them.  The only thing I might do differently next time is to use roasted red peppers instead of raw.  The raw ones were fine, though, and lent a definite contrast in textures to the salad.",

Red potatoes do worth best but fingerlings are nice as well. Spring onions are a wonderful addition and a can of good quality tuna will make it a light meal. Pesto makes an outstanding dressing, as does a lemon vinaigrette. A dash of red or white wine vinegar on the potatoes while they are still warm and before adding the dressing will brighten the flavor of the entire salad. Made in quantity this is perfect for a summer BBQ party and has always been a big hit.",

      "Review": "It states marinated but there were no marinating instructions. However, it could be stood as long as people like. It certainly wasn't marinated here,it didn't last that long. Was having a salad spread, wanted potato salad (usually with mayo involved here) &amp; saw this in my inbox. I used whole french beans (cut up finely as a UK supermarket has found needles in long beans recently). I used Red-skin potatoes, don't think I've seen baby ones, but they have white flesh unlike your picture, nor are they as firm but they are perfectly acceptable. You said sweet red bell pepper, I didn't know if this was different from a standard one (only 1 choice of 'bell' pepper in the UK - called just 'peppers') so I used 2 long pointy peppers that said 'sweet' on the pack. Also, onions; apart from red onion &amp; shallots, there are onions (of various sizes) &amp; (tiny) pickling onions in the supermarkets - they both have brown skins &amp; white flesh, neither are sweet! I ended up using a shallot. I've often wished the US was a lot closer as you have a lot more variations, some British farmers have been told not to grow certain varieties of tomatoes &amp; they are dying out. I managed to make an acceptable version of this for lunch. I will make more later as the dressing quantity is about 1 Pint. Some other time I will try with tarragon like another reviewer mentioned. I will also make with dry-roast cumin seeds when I make an 'Indian' spread.",

I cut this recipe in half as there were only 2 of us, added some minced garlic (a must for nearly anything I cook) and sprinkled with a little parmesan cheese. These were awesome. Two of my DH's favorite things are CRAB and mushrooms so the combination was incredible. Thanks for a great recipe and forgiveness of my typos. lol",

Definately start out with 1 cup of cranberry juice! The apples make it juicy and I did not need to add more.  I peeled my apples, my picky kids prob would not have eaten it if I left them on. The only thing I did different was to add a little bit of cinnamon when it was done.  All in all, it is very good and I will make it again.  Thanks bikerchick for sharing the recipe!  Renee",

      "Review": "This recipe inspired me to make my own applesauce instead of purchasing it.  I replaced the McIntosh apples with Jonagolds, used cinnamon instead of star anise and concentrated black cherry juice instead of cranberry juice.  The apples were quite juicy enough without the extra liquid, so I just added enough concentrate to sweeten a little. My mother used to make her own sauce and freeze it.  I miss her and her sauce.  This is easy and I'll be freezing my own from now on.  Thank you for the reminder of my mother and the inspiration. My 14 month old grandson got a taste of it and signed for more.  My mother's legacy will live on in her great grandson thanks to you.",

I understand lemon juice also turns applesauce pink. Most difficult part is peeling and coring the apples but I just got a mechanical one for Christmas so I'm looking forward to next year's apple crop.  I'll zoom through this and I'll also try sugar free white grape juice for sweetening and skip the lemon juice.",

The rice krispies adds a nice crunch compared to the popcorn. I just poured the mixture onto some foil, instead of using a baking pan, for easy clean up. The clumps seemed to fall apart easily though so I'm not sure how good of a party nibble it would be. More casual dining or in front of the TV munching snack.",

Even without the apple though they would still be delicious. I only did 1/2 the recipe to try it out. I didn't have large marshmallows so I used 1/2 cup of minis. I put the apple & marshmallows in a large bowl, then coated with the margarine, & then with the sugar mixture. On the sugar mix I did 2 Tbsp Splenda plus 1 Tbsp white sugar. It didn't get too messy putting them together but they do get very sticky very quick. I also skipped the muffin liners & didn't have any problems getting them out. By the way, I had probably at least a fourth extra of filling so I might reduce the amounts slightly next time. Using the reduced fat crescents and with my slight changes, this comes up to 3 points each, which they are certainly worth & so much better than the alternative! Thank you so much for this yummy treat!",

      "Review": "Wow, wow, wow, were these ever good! I made these on whole wheat pitas, and added some mushrooms while frying the onion. I had no mozzarella, so used a sharp cheddar, but stayed with the spirit of the recipe and I don't think these changes made any difference in the outcome, so I feel safe in rating it 5 stars. The pitas came out crisp and light, they were a great pizza crust, and the toppings were just the right amount for 2 pitas. This is something I will make many, many times more, what a great way to use up left-over beef! Thanks Paula! :)",

I made the dough the evening before and let it chill overnight. The only thing that I would do differently next time is add more powdered sugar to the 'icing'. With only 1/4 cup, the peanut butter stayed sticky. No one seemed to care as they devoured them but it did mean I couldn't stack them on top of each other on the plate very well. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!",

The topping was way too moist - I doubled the icing sugar & the topping was still quite sticky even after refrigeration.  Although not a bad cookie, they are definitely not worth the time involved.",

I am pretty sure that the ingredients should be 1 1/4 cup. powder sugar and 1/4 cup peanut butter as with any other butter cream type frosting this would be the ratio. I think the amounts just were mixed up with the ingredients.",

I halved this recipe and used 1/2 tablespoon of oil along with 1 tablespoon of light butter.  What I loved about the dish was that the delicate flavors of the veggies were the focus, no heavy herbs and seasonings, just beautifully cooked and caramelized vegetables. My pan cooked for 40 to 42 minutes at which point both the potatoes and fennel were perfect.  Did not follow directions carefully and my inch thick carrot pieces were just a wee bit underdone.  My fault here. The servings here were quite generous, not a problem as the leftovers will make a great lunch tomorrow. Thanks!",

Thanks for posting!!\r\n\r\nETA -- I tried cubing the bread, and it did work out much better.  Also, for anyone who wants to cut it down to a single serving... I used a small whole wheat roll, one egg white, 1/3 cup soy milk, 2 T Splenda, 1 t applesauce, 1 t vanilla, 1/4 t cinnamon, and a pinch each nutmeg and salt.

This wk I made your recipe a dy early for us & had a sml indulgence for this review. Lacking an 8x8 sq baking pan, I made a full recipe in a 9-in rd pie plate. It worked very well & gave an almost frosted look to the cake. This cake is pretty, easy to fix & yummy to eat. The turn out was a tiny bit stubborn till I ran a sharp knife down the slope of the pie pan & then was fine. The cake tested done at the baking time stated in the recipe, but sunk slightly in the center & I feared it was underdone. I was wrong & suspect this may be normal for this cake that has a dense texture like a pound cake. We both loved this cake! Thx for sharing this great recipe w/us. Yum!",

But 1/4 cup was too much I think.  1/8 cup would have been better.  Cause when I turned the cake, the bottom did't want to fall completely.  After 40 minutes, I felt that the cake was not cooked enough.  I left it for another 5 minutes.  And it was perfect.  It had a nice little golden color, but not too much.  Thanks Elmotoo.

I added a scoop of ice cream to each serving.  Wow!  I took mine out at exactly 40 minutes, but probably could have done so a couple minutes sooner - it was starting to pull away from the edges.  I loosened the edges with a knife before turning it over, and only lost about a square inch of the blueberry topping, which was very easy to correct - no one was the wiser.  Thank you Elmotoo!

Since I was using the oven for casserole later, baked about 4 PM, and let sit in the pan til serving.  I think that allowed the juices to absorb into the cake, making it not very juicy as it would have been warm.  Found the whipped cream was gone (SHOCK), so topped with butter crunch ice cream.  DH ate TWO large bowls, and we had the rest for breakfast !  Thanks for posting, Bethie -- will be doing this frequently !!",

A sprinkle of toasted almonds would be a nice touch, too. Easy as pie to put together, especially since I micro-steamed the carrots briefly. Thanks for posting. cg",

I prepared and cooked them exactly as stated in the recipe. \"Real\" scotch eggs (although a English invention) are made with sausage meat, not ham and anchovies. I don't know what the \"Two Fat Ladies\" were thinking when they dubbed them \"Real\" scotch eggs.",

      "Review": "Outstanding!  I made as directed with just a couple of changes:  my canned chicken was 12 oz, so that's what I put in, and I highly recommend the increased amount as I think the chicken might have gone missing in the cheese without it. :)  I also decreased the green chilies to 1 can, and the hot sauce to 2 tsp.  That was just so my kids would eat it; it was great with the lesser amounts but would be good with the amounts listed, too, if you like it spicier.  For the seasoned salt I used Lawry's which was great; I could taste a hint of the sweetness & paprika which gave the dip some depth.  I cooked it in the glass bowl I had mixed it in for 3 minutes and it was almost boiling - could 10 microwave minutes be a typo?  Then I transferred to a serving dish, and topped with a bit more grated cheese and the chopped veggies.  It was beautiful and delicious; I plan to make again and have added it to my Book #224537 cookbook.",

I had never cooked mussels before (or clams for that matter) and couldnt get the slimey suckers out of the shells.  So I cleaned the outsides and threw them all into the soup twards the end.  They opened up after 3 minutes or so and the meaty part came out easily.  I discarded shells. I think the mussels did the trick too :)  This was very yummy soup.  I served with Recipe #210020.

      "Review": "This was okay but I think when the recipe says 2 (8 ounce) cans of stewed tomatoes it means a 28 ounce can.  When I put it together using 16 ounces of tomatoes, there was not nearly enough liquid to do any simmering!  Just my luck I didn't have any more tomatoes so I used 1 1/2 cups of beef broth.  If I were to make this again I would use more tomatoes and add more spices - maybe a little cumin or cayenne.",

I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic (crushed), one 14-ounce tin of corn kernels (drained) because they were on hand, and 1 teaspoon of cumin and 28 ounces of tomatoes (as per loof's suggestion). The Italian seasoning contributes a lot of flavour. KathieJo, your family is lucky to have such a nice meal on a cold winter night. Made and enjoyed for Pick a Chef.",

I bought 6 chicken shnitzels and just upped the ingredients to accomodate without really measuring.  I didn't have any apricot brandy, so I used orange juice.  I also left off the sour cream as we don't mix dairy with poultry.  For the same reason the butter became margarine.  I cooked up the whole thing in a ridged grill pan and the chicken was tender and just the way we like it.  I served this with Recipe #206691 and an Israeli salad.  The family loved it, and I believe this is \"guest-worthy\" as well!",

      "Review": "I liked this dish because it has good balanced flavor with the onion and spices.  Besides cutting the turmeric in half, the only change I made was to saute the onions and spices before adding in the liquids and peas to develop the flavor a bit.  That's just the way I learned to make dal and I find it works well.  \r\n\r\nWhile I love the name of this dish, I wanted and expected more coconut flavor; I think the coconut milk adds depth, but does not give a flavor that you can easily identify if you don't know it's in there!  \r\nThat said, the peas absorbed all the liquid and cooked al dente in the 35 minute span, so I added 1/2 cup more broth and let it go another 10 minutes to get a bit softer texture(I am feeding an 11 month old and 4 1/2 year old, so texture is key!).  This dish is a beautiful golden yellow and when it's hot, is coated in a thick creamy sauce.  Upon standing, the sauce absorbs quickly, but a little water or stock with reheating does the trick again!\r\n  \r\nSince I really want more coconut flavor, next time I try this I will add some coconut creme concentrate from Tropical Traditions as I find that it imparts an excellent coconut flavor.  Fresh grated coconut would also be a nice garnish if you've got it. \r\n\r\nAll in all, a good savory dal that can easily be adapted to suit your tastes.  Thanks for sharing!",

Added some chopped bacon and some cheese, used hot english mustard, I think you can use more mustard. I put 1/4 tsp cream of tartar in to make the eggs a little fluffier and whipped them for a few minutes.  I also think mixing everything but the eggs together at the beginning makes a more even mix.

      "Review": "I made this yesterday for Christmas breakfast and it was a huge hit. I prefer fresh fruit, but everyone else raved over this. It's kind of like a healthier, not-so-sweet and much better version of canned fruit cocktail. I tried to cut the recipe in half, which was a little tricky b/c I could only find 20 oz. cans of pineapple and ended up using the full 16 oz of mandarin oranges for color. I added fresh red grapes for more texture and color as well.\r\nOverall, I will probably make this again for guests, but if you're feeding fresh-fruit lovers, you probably want to go another way.",

When I first saw this I thought that the figs and candied ginger would supply all of the sweetness needed but for myself I found that it needed a bit of extra help in that department.

I served with the napa cabbage as directed.  It was wonderful!  The salsa and sauce both made more than we needed for one sitting, and I'm sure the leftovers will be enjoyed as well.

      "Review": "I have made this dish twice--once with re-purposed chicken from two different recipes that needed eating and the other time with leftover Christmas turkey. It is delicious! My whole family loved it. I eyeballed the vegetables, probably putting in half as much again as the recipe calls for (gotta sneak those veggies in whenever I can for the kids) and used half boxes of leftover pasta each time, to use them up. Didn&#039;t have the breadcrumbs and too lazy to make them, so just topped the casseroles with cheese. Didn&#039;t read the recipe right and didn&#039;t cover during baking. Turned out great each time. My family liked it so much that I&#039;m going to make extra of another family baked chicken favorite, just so I&#039;ll have leftover chicken to use to make this casserole.",

Except for using a diced red pepper instead of sun-dried tomatoes - which I don't greatly care for - I made this exactly to the recipe.  A delicious blend of flavours and so pleasingly low in fat and calories.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Jess; and for being okay about my using red pepper instead of sun-dried tomatoes.  I'll certainly be making this again for healthy, yummy take-to-work lunches.  Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders.",

      "Review": "Well, I'm nor sure if it was because of my substitutions, but we found that this didn't have much flavor.  It wasn't BAD, it just didn't taste like much of anything at all.  I used Aunt Jemima whole wheat pancake mix, two egg whites, soy milk, and sugar-free peaches.  It could have used some more sweetener, or cinnamon, or SOMETHING... also, I think I'd try this with pineapple next time, because that would probably just have a stronger flavor.

I made it while DH was out this afternoon and very briefly dropped them into the deep fryer (that I haven't used in 2 1/2 yrs!) just to get them evenly browned all around. At that point I stashed them in the oven warmer and made the rest of dinner. When DH got home everything was almost ready and I served him  \"meatballs in mushroom sauce\" on brown rice. He LOVED them and had no idea that they weren't beef! I'm not about to tell him either, LOL. I used all egg white for the whole eggs, old fashioned oats and a dark whole grain cracker. I'm simply awed by this delicious recipe. It will reappear without doubt (DH has already ask for a meatball sandwich made with some of the extra balls). Thank you very much for posting this one Dreamer.",

      "Review": "A very unusual recipe that I'm classifying as a GREAT FIND recipe... healthy and delicious and I'd really defy anyone to know that these weren't - let's say \"regular\" - tasty meatballs.  And I do love cooking \"meatballs\" in the oven: so much easier for minimal preparation!  We have zero tolerance of anything hot and spicy, so I omitted the chilli powder and for the sage I used grindings of a wonderfully flavoursome rosemary and sage blend that I've been using in a lot of recipes recently.  I used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat milk, without (I believe) compromising flavour. And like Annacia's husband, I SO enjoyed some of these mock meatballs in a take-to-work sandwich next day - except perhaps that I knew that they were \"mockballs\"!  I made these \"mockballs\" for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders, but this is a recipe that truly deserves super-stardom.  Thank you so much for sharing it, Dreamer!",

      "Review": "Update: Rather than the mushroom soup I decided to make my Recipe #356086. I doubled the milk in that recipe but nothng else so it was a little liquidy and I added dill to both the balls and the spinach. I made the balls using a measuring tablespoon, put them in the pan and poured the creamed spinach over the top. Then I filled in here and there with a little warm milk so only the tops of the balls were uncovered. I baked, uncovered for 45 minutes. This was amazing! My first review on Jan 19, 2009: My husband said \"OMG these are great they taste like stuffing balls.\" These wouldn't have fooled anyone into thinking that they're meat...maybe thats because I used quick cooking oats and small curd cottage cheese (don't know what cream style is)...but they were still wonderful...I left out the chili powder and added garlic powder. I also doubled the meatball recipe but trippled the sauce...by the end there really wasn't enough sauce to serve over the noodles I made...next time I will make extra sauce in a pan...I also added dill to the mushroom soup and frozen peas...I think some lemon zest would be nice too...This made for a pretty starchy meal when served over pasta or rice (good tho), I think next times I may make these with wilted spinach and another veggie or beans or something...I will be making these again...cheap, easy and tasty, what more can you want :)",

But if you want enough sauce to serve with pasta, you may want to double it, or make a second batch on the stove. Next time I'll spray the pan with non-stick spray, they did stick just a little bit. Like another reviewer said, I don't think these will fool anyone into thinking they are meat. But they just might like them better!!",

I agree with all other reviewers who have said that these taste like stuffing balls.  Even the texture and appearance was that of stuffing.  Not that that is a bad thing.  These really are quite good, and my kids and I enjoyed them for lunch.  But even my very young children could not be fooled into thinking that this was made with meat.  Doesn't matter, because they still enjoyed them--because they tasted like stuffing, which they love.  :)",

I don't like creoles very much, but yours was as good as any I have tried.    Thanks for posting tunamanphd!  Made for Fall 2011 PAC",

I have stashed it away and will make it with some bread next week using your soak method.  I did sub flax meal for the rye flakes and then subbed oatmeal for the flax seed. THANKS!  Made as a recipenap for March 2010 Veggie Swap.  UPDATE:  I continue to use this in most of the breads I make as we love multi-grain breads.  Most recently I used it in Recipe #412480, subbing out the nuts for this grain blend.  YUMMO!  We love it and I highly recommend it.",

I love how versatile it is.  Using your recipe I put together a large batch from the grain bins at my local hippie grocery store, replacing the couple of ingredients that weren&#039;t available with ones that were.  I got about 6 lbs of the mixture for under $13.  I subbed out 1/4 cup of the mixture in a simple bread machine egg bread recipe, and it has added wonderful texture and depth of flavor.

With all the different ingredients in this recipe you know it's good.I have a lot of Roma tomates from it being so hot this summer and the canning season is about 3-4 weeks early. I usually just make the stewed tomatoes from a very basic recipe I have.Trying to find a new one and came across this recipe.Once you have these tomatoes canned you will be able to have fresh stewed tomatoes for your favorite recipe all year long. I will be canning around 60 or more quarts. If you have never canned give it a try it's very easy and you have fresh fruit or vestables all year long.For this recipe I will use 1/2 peck Roma Tomatoes following the recipe unless I need to add a little more of each item.",

I would suggest those looking for a true dairy free recipe (especially those avoiding dairy due to allergies) to use coconut milk or another dairy free alternative for this recipe.",

Who knew soy milk could bake and taste just as good as cow's milk? Thanks so much for the recipe. I also used soy milk in the icing instead of regular milk, and that was excellent too. :)",

      "Review": "This is a good, basic sugar cookie recipe that&#039;s dairy free. The dough has a nice texture and is easy to work with. I used half spectrum veggie shortening and half coconut oil for my fats. Bake time turned out to be about 11 minutes @ 375 using professional aluminum bake sheets and silpat mats.",

      "Review": "These Dairy-free sugar cookies were amazing. I've been looking for a delicious alternative since finding out my son is lactose-intolerant.. although I made some minor changes to the recipe.. I used two sticks of earth balance butter and almond milk. I rolled them into balls then patted them down to about 1/4&quot; think and baked until the bottoms edges were a bit brown. About 8-9 mins. I also added chocolate chips to the last batch and they came out scrumptious.. definitely my go to cookie recipe ?? Very delicious",

      "Review": "Really impressed with the flavour - similar to those pillsbury cookie dough you find in the stores. Not dairy free myself, but my nieces are and made these for us to decorate. Came out great. However, I will say that the dough was SUPER crumbly and hard to roll out after leaving in the fridge. I am thinking it would be easier to roll directly after making as once it softened up a bit it was easier. Baked 375 for 10 minutes in my oven. Made approx 40 cookies (some small, some medium).",

      "Review": "The recipe definitely needs some tweaking the dough was a little dry so I added a little bit extra soy milk probably one or two tablespoons and then it was perfect but after refrigerating it was crumbly again. I had to mix in 4 more tablespoons of soy milk to save it, it would have been better just to roll it out right away instead of refrigerating. Otherwise the flavour was good the ingredients are perfect and I'm happy to find a dairy free cookie recipe that's easy.",

      "Review": "Very unusual and very tasty burger!  I had a bit of trouble getting the ham patties to stick together while grilling so might try to add some kind of binder next time.  I was surprised at the addition of the basil to this but WOW it was terrific and for me what made these great.  Both in the dressing mix and on top with the pineapple, the basil was the perfect compliment to the ham.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

      "Review": "Sooo goood!! They have a texture very similar to a granola bar, but with a more special flavor. I love the cerries in it, and I don't usullay like candied cherries :) They also smelled amazing while they were baking. Even DH said, \"those are pretty good granola bars.\" and he is not sweets person at all! They store very well in a ziplock bag, but do become a little more chewy and less crispy after a day or so. Not that that's a bad thing!",

Flavor was wonderful however I don't think I pressed it down hard enough before baking . . . it didn't hold together very well.  Very flavorful!",

The potatoes were really quick and easy to throw together, with ingredients always found in the fridge and pantry.  The crispy potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned, the cheese was a great touch. We enjoyed these spuds very much, thanks so much for sharing your recipe Chef #772690 .",
