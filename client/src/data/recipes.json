She had found the recipe in a newspaper clip-out.  All the recipes\/items brought were turned into a GS Cookbook for our region.  When we received our cookbook - low and behold we were missing a few pages and of course this recipe was on those pages.  It has taken me 30 years to find this recipe (well I did not search all 30 but it did take over a year of hard searching to find it).  A man (no name ever given) from a community recipe group I belong shared this recipe after I posted again of my search.  My mom is thrilled as it is the recipe she remembers and now I will have more than just the memory of these yummy rolls but also of the history that goes along with it.  I probably would have forgotten that potluck dinner with the other Girl Scouts if it were not for this lost recipe that now has been found.  I hope you too enjoy them and make special memories with your family and friends when you serve them.",

    "Description":"I found this on one of those little grocery store recipe cards.  I love the combination of rhubarb and strawberries anyway so this is a fun way to serve that as a crisp.  The card shows how to make this on the &quot;grill&quot; which is basically putting the dish on the cool side of a grill and cooking covered for 25 minutes.  That means if you don't want to turn on an oven you can still make this dish.  The other option would be your oven and you would bake uncovered for 20-25 minutes.  Either way it is great and even more wonderful with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.",

NOTE: Per request I revised this from my original post to reduce fat and calories. Please let me know if you like the new version as much as the old. The potatoes will cook much faster if you microwave them for a few minutes before placing them in the pan with the rest of the veggies.",

This is a more traditional scone recipe, somewhat (although not exactly) like the kind you would find in England.\r\n\r\nFeel free to play around with the amounts of cinnamon and almond.  The almond can easily be cut down to 1\/2 teaspoon if you'd like more of the cinnamon and maple flavor to come out.  The maple flavor will be very subtle either way, but always delicious!\r\n\r\nI prefer them unglazed (and it's healthier anyway)!",

For a smaller pan and stovetop cooking half the recipe.\r\nNote: Some purists say an 'authentic' paella doesn't mix meat and seafood. I see it as a matter of taste, and most of the paella I've had from various regions throughout Spain has been mixed. I leave the arguments to the old men in Valencia.",

      "This is where paella is made and broken. I stir a few times in the first 5-10 minutes, adding broth as necessary to keep the rice fully covered. After this you must let the paella SIT! Let it cook another 10-20 minutes (I find that this step takes longer on a stovetop], adding broth bit by bit to keep the rice submerged until the rice on the top is al dente. Don't worry about rice burning to the bottom, this part (which actually has a name which escapes me at the moment, it's something like socarrat] is a tasty delicacy.",
      "Once you've stirred the paella for the last time and are letting cook, when you have about 8 minutes left to cook lay shrimp on top, turning over after 2-4 minutes to cook other side.",
      "When the rice on top is still quite al dente, take paella off of heat and cover. You must let it sit for 15-20 minutes. I've taken the lid off prematurely and ended up with a crunchy mess. Patience is the key.",

This version of the original bar is from Company's Coming - 150 Delicious Squares! Later versions change the vanilla custard layer to mint or peanut butter but the original is my favourite.\r\nYou can make this a day ahead of a special occasion or keep it in the freezer. I used to freeze half because I'm very weak &amp; I would eat the whole thing myself BUT I soon discovered that it tastes good even when its frozen!",

    "Description":"This is a variation on my family's favorite chicken soup that I have already posted here.  Lots of carrots and parsnips give it more of a sweet savor.  The parsley actually balances the sweetness, though. To balance this effect, use the optional parsley, which is just slightly bitter.  Sometimes I also add a diced turnip if I have one.   For the noodles, I like to use tagliolini nests, which you can usually find in the imported pasta section.  I prefer a thin noodle for this soup, but you can certainly use whatever is your preference.",

    "Description":"NOTE ADDED Jan 27, 2012:  Please note that this is NOT a serious cake recipe! It is a fun recipe, for a quick choc snack. It may work for you, or you may have to make adjustments, or it might not work for you. Please do not judge this little recipe as if it is a chocolate cake -- as you will see from the reviews, they range from &quot;great!&quot; to &quot;awful!&quot; LOL! \r\n\r\nORIGINAL INTRO: This recipe is doing the e-mail rounds! I do not know where it originated, but if you have kids, teenagers, or a sweet tooth yourself, it works!!  A chocolate cake in a mug, for one person! Do use a LARGE mug!  I never, ever post recipes like this which I have not made, and I'm not a microwave fan, but this one, for parents of the above-mentioned people, just has to be posted. Delicious with whipped cream, ice cream or custard, they say! It must be great to mix a choc cake in a mug, and have a hot &quot;cake&quot; within 3 minutes!!",

    "Description":"One of the many recipes pulled from my Granny's good ol' country cookbooks!  I've been making this since I got married (in 1995).  I recently misplaced it (obviously found it now) and tried in vain to find the recipe elsewhere.  I tried several different recipes and none came close to this one.  Could be sentimentality, but I think it's the best one out there!  I often substitute some unsweetened applesauce for some of the shortening and whole grain flour for all purpose, but for the best pound cake texture and, if it's for a treat - go all out and make it as written! If it lasts long enough, the flavor gets better with each day that passes.  I have tried in the past to wrap it and let it sit for a few days, but with my houseful of hungry little beggars, that rarely happens.  As soon as they smell it baking, they're waiting with hands outstretched....",
