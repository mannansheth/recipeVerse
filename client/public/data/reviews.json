Very good and easy .Prep time about 5 mins",

This recipe is the best!\r\n\r\nIt comes from the Five Roses cookbook, and the baking directions I've always used are:\r\nBake in a hot oven (450*) for 8 minutes, reduce temperature to 350* and bake 15 to 20 minutes longer or until pastry is delicately brown.\r\nJR\r\nGolden, CO",

This is the 5 Roses Recipe I found on their website: Filling:  2 eggs, 1 cup (250 mL) brown sugar, ½ tsp (2 mL) salt, 1 tbsp (15 mL) cider vinegar, ½ cup (125 mL) maple syrup, ? cup (75 mL) butter, melted, ¾ cup (175 mL) walnut, chopped, ½ cup (125 mL) currants, ½ cup (125 mL) raisins  >http://www.fiveroses.ca/OurRecipes/RecipeDetail/4887?categoryId=234",

      "Review": "These are the butter tarts my mother always made. I have her 1958 edition of the Five Roses flour recipe book open in front of me now and the recipe is the same as the one printed except the cookbook says to use 2 tblsp of milk or cream, 1/2 cup of currants (not raisins or nuts) and 1/3 cup butter. My mother always used currants and I do too. There is no maple syrup in the recipe, only brown sugar. Many butter tart recipes use maple syrup and, for some strange reason, vinegar. For me, the old Five Roses recipe is still the most authentic and the best.",

      "Review": "When I first tasted these I thought they were way too sweet for my taste. I had made them for some friends but kept part of them for my husband and myself. I kept them in the fridge and each day would eat a little bit more (I didn't want them to be wasted) and now I think they are really wonderful. They have a different taste at room temperature than when they are cold. \r\nThe friends I gave them to like them and the husband said he ate more than his share.\r\nSince I don't have a microwave, it was time consuming to melt the chocolate and then the caramels in a double boiler so I won't make them often but just for special occasions.\r\n\r\nCindy\r\n",

I cristened it with this dish and could not have made a better choice (I did make just a quarter recipe). It turns out that curacao (the liqueur I used) does something wonderful to the flavor of raspberries. My verdict: A lovely light dessert glorifying my favorite kind of melon. P.S. I was bad and did not push the raspberry pulp through a sieve to remove the seeds--didn't bother me a bit.",

I was not aware that they would expand.\r\n\r\nDespite all of that, and with some pure guesswork on my part, they tasted wonderful. I would have given you 5 stars, but you made me do too much thinking and guessing, so I kept a couple of the stars for myself!",

      "Review": "Despite the vague directions, I thought these cookies tasted great- texture and flavor-wise. They didn't look very pretty out of the oven- so next time I will use more white sugar and less brown for a nicer color.  These spread a lot on me, so next time I'll use less oats and more flour. I would cook it @ 325 on the top rack for 8mins and the bottom rack for 3mins. I also added butterscotch chips which really complimented the raisins quite nicely.",

He plows our yard for us all winter long and since he refuses pay I try to bake something when it snows so I can give him a tray when he is plowing to take home. After just one cookie he was in love he said these tasted quite similar to a cookie that his grandmother made for him when he was a boy and they where his favorites. so thank you so much for this post It is now a treasured recipe for my family. And a winter staple so I always have them when a sudden storm pops up.",

      "Review": "I found this recipe when searching for Christmas cookie recipes and have made it several times since by my husbands request.  I just made a double batch and my husband was right there when I took them out of the oven.   I don't bake them all at once.  Usually one or two cookie sheets and freeze the dough for later baking.  I think the oatmeal softens up and makes a better cookie if you wait anyway.  I use a teaspoon of cinnamon and I put dates in for more flavor but these cookies are delicious and soft,  thanks for a great recipe",

You wouldn't want to let the salmon and lime rest for more than the 10 minutes, because the acid would start eating into the fish. \r\nI used a salmon fillet instead of steaks,  so I only basted the marinade on the top part.   I reserved a little to use as part of a garnish.   This was great with an avocado salad , some butter sauteed potatoes and a hot baguette.  ",

The only thing I did differently was I broiled for 10 mins, then flipped and baked till done at 425 degrees. This made the top of the salmon with the cilantro mix taste very infused!

My only problem with it was that the blueberries tasted more like raisins to me (not a big raisin fan), but that could have possibly been due to the tanginess of the lemon glaze. I'll have to try this without the glaze and see. Everyone else who tried it really enjoyed it, though, so it's a good recipe overall.",

She cut it up to look like a star and placed sliced strawberries around it.  Received a very nice trophy too!\r\n\r\nAbsolutely wonderful! Not overpowering gingerbread flavor -- the blueberries make the difference. I used a 11 x 8 baking dish. Served as is (no additional butter or whipped cream). I would suggest that you don't cover it tightly...the sugar tends to be absorbed and you lose the crunchy top created by the sugar. This is a keeper!",

Just wanted to say that instead of beef in the jar, I have had much better results from \"air-dried beef\" in the package. Carson's is the best but hard to find here in FL. Wal-mart sells Knauss brand which is pretty good. Eliminates the soaking or rinsing process. A great \"sticks to the ribs\" meal served any time!",

When my mom first served this to me as a child (many moons ago), she had introduced me to a dish that would remain a favorite of mine from then on. Over the years, I've served this meal to my children and their friends and now my grandchilden. I've never come across a person who didn't enjoy this. SOS is quick and easy to prepare. I serve this gravy over toast or biscuits (my preferred accompaniments), but I have also served over mashed potatoes or noodles. Occasionally, I will add peas to the dish, depending on my mood. However you decide to serve this, it is a winner with everybody. Enjoy! Note: Dried beef is very salty, if you wish, soak it in a water wash prior to cooking if you wish to reduced the saltiness. I hope you all enjoy this as much as my family does.",

      "Review": "This recipe was outstanding, 5 stars from all the family, my sister said more than 5 if we could! I doubled the sauce because I was sure we'd like it & served the chicken over rice with broccoli. The only substitutions I made was to omit the oil in Step 10 & use lemon instead of lime because that's what I had. It was a small lemon, but I think it gave me more juice than the lime would have. Upon tasting the sauce it was a bit too tangy, but I fixed this with a couple of Tbs of cream which smoothed out the flavour beautifully. I also loved the way the chicken cooked, because of the high heat you recommended the chicken was golden brown & crisp, but moist on the inside. This is a DEFINITE keeper, thanks Wendy N!",

Instead of oil and butter I used veggie spray on the pan and just added 1 teaspoon of butter in the sauce, an absolutley delicious sauce! Also used home made chicken stock. This is a great tasting chicken, the sauce makes it outstanding.  Thanks for sharing we will make it again.",

My one complaint is the minor one that, using relatively large chicken breast halves as instructed, there was barely enough sauce for each one.

I loved the brown crustiness they got, but mine dried out a bit.(they may just have been too small)  And I'll be careful with the lime juice...the lime I had was large and very juicy resulting in just a bit too much tartness.  But regardless, this is as close to perfect as a recipe can get...easy, quick, and with true gourmet flavor that I'd be proud to serve my guests.",

I think I would have had to double the sauce if I had made the 4 chicken breasts suggested.  Also, I used scallions instead of chives, and used closer to 1/2 c. of chicken broth.  This is a mustard-intense dish, so I added additional lime juice to balance out the overpowering mustard taste, which I would have liked but my husband would not have.  Also, 4 minutes per side was not long enough to cook the chicken for me.  I cooked a total of about 6 minutes per side, and the chicken came out juicy and well-cooked.  I served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  I would definitely make this dish again.  Thank you.",

Using maple whiskey instead of brandy but keeping everything else, I made the sauce. It did not seem liquidy enough. Looked like chives and parsley tossed in a light vinaigrette. Should I just add more broth next time?",

It set up just abit firmer than the sugar-free cherry jello I used as a base. Similar to panna cotta with a tasty additional richness from the sour cream ( refreshing & nice change from cloying Cool Whip & unctous whipped cream). Delicious & a much appreciated change to have with the jello which is a large part of my eating experience right now. Thank you, dojemi, for this yum recipe I will use even after my mouth heals up!",

The rolls rose nice and high and had a wonderful taste. The filling leaked out a bit and so we had a nice crust on the bottom and the frosting was to die for! My mom who has been baking for over fifty years said \"We should save that glaze recipe.\" The only thing I can on the lesser side is that I wish there would have been a bit more orange flavor, the lemon in the frosting shown through a bit more than the orange but that could have been my rind. This recipe is a must try for all IMHO!",

Wow, I'd love to eat another, but since I made 12 larger rolls rather than 30, I think 1 should be my limit (at least for the moment...). I had some leftover cream cheese frosting to which I added a bit of orange juice and that topped these nicely. I used 1 c soy flour and 2 1/2 c bread flour, and used light butter and part splenda in the filling to good effect. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe. I was ready for something different from cinnamon rolls, and these really hit the spot. I can see varying the filling, adding lime or lemon zest instead of orange, or flavoring with nutmeg rather than citrus. Thanks for posting!",

I used one of those little plastic squeeze bottle for condiments to spread the glaze.  However, my glaze was a little thin with only 1 cup of pwd. sugar, so I added some more.  YUMMY!!!!",

      "Review": "These are FANTASTIC!  Like other reviewers, I also used butter instead of shortening, and baked them in three round non-stick cake pans.  Two words of warning - the first one is that this recipe makes a lot of rolls, so be prepared to share them!  Believe me, the people you give them to will come back to you with great praise.  The second word of warning is that you must get these out of the pan(s) quickly.  I didn't, and they stuck (and I do mean STUCK) bigtime, even with well-greased non-stick pans.  To resolve the sticking, I put the pans on the warming burner on my stove and was able to loosen them, but it was a very scary 25 minutes of getting them out without damaging them.  I also made an Orange Cream Cheese frosting with 4 oz cream cheese, 4 Tbsp butter, 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp fresh orange juice, 1/2 tsp orange extract and a dash of orange rind.  No lemon.  Being from Florida, I have to confess I used awesome 'fresh off the tree' Orlando Tangeloes, which have a very rich and sweet flavor, both in the rind and in the juice.\r\nThis is a truly great recipe that I expect to make again.

Added the clothes and socks letting them run as a wash for 10 minutes, turned off the machine ( only have a max 12 minute cycle ), reset the machine back to 12 minutes, did another 10 minute cycle, shut it down at that point, then forgot about them till the next day ( what can I say..LOL ), I then washed as usual after completing the full cycle. I've never seen white so white, it didn't bleed nor fade any of the colours and it dissolved the ground in dirt..AMAZING !!!!!.. Thank you for an awesome recipe, It cost me $.71 total for the soda & perox. It doesn't get any better than this !!! And, yes I will still \" borrow \" his socks. Keeps him happy, his knowing I'm so logical when it comes to seeing how dirty the floors can get so quickly...Thank you again for this recipe, it's the best !!!!! ",

      "Review": "Okay, I was skeptical. But...wow! I gathered up some clothing items that were stained (old stains and fresh stains) including a clean article of clothing that happened to have an old, largish blood stain. I ran some hot water into my washer, added a full bottle of hydrogen peroxide as well as 2 cups of baking soda, then ran more hot water into the washer -- enough to cover all the clothing items. I likely watered down the mixture too much, but even so the results were highly impressive. Most impressive were 2 items: firstly, an old pale-yellow sweatshirt I wear around the house (and often wear when cooking) that had lots of old pale stains. They disappeared! And secondly, the large bloodstained item had the stain disappear by about 80%, and also lightened up. And this stain was OLD! I will definitely pretreat my clothing with this solution again; next I'm going to try it on old gungy socks. Thanks for posting this :-)",

      "Review": "This.  Stuff.  Is.  AMAZING!!!  Honestly, I've only used it on one thing so far, and I am literally amazed with the results.  I dumped several Tablespoons worth of curry powder on to my lap.  On to my favorite brand-new pale blue pants!  I rushed them to the wash, hoping I could get it out if I just washed them quickly... and I pulled the pants out of the washer with the entire lap covered with a huge BRIGHT yellow spot.  I got upset, told BF that my pants were ruined and that I could never wear them again which was terrible since they're my favorites and I JUST got them (okay I was being dramatic, but you should have seen this stain!!).  I remembered this recipe and figured it was worth a shot.  I poured the ingredients on the stains and let it soak.  After an hour the stain turned brownish.  A couple more and it was gone!  I hand-washed the stained area in Woolite and hung these up to dry.  Not a HINT of yellow.  You could not guess that I had spilled something like turmeric, which is used as a DYE on these pants (and then been so brilliant as to get it wet and set a stain that was just a powder *roll*).  Just for fixing my favorite pants this recipe deserves a million stars!!!!  I can't wait to try it on some older stains- sweat stains, blood stains, tea/coffee stains!  From the job it did on my pants, I'm sure it will work wonders!!  Thank you so much for posting;  I will report back when I try this on other stained stuff that I thought was destined for the dump!!",

It costs less than using half a bottle of peroxide and half a box of baking soda per load. I might try it if I need a stubborn stain removed though.  Okay, I just tried it for removing spaghetti sauce from my 4 yo's (new) grey sweatshirt that was left overnight.  I soaked it in this solution and everything came out!  So it does work great for soaking individual garments that have been stained.",

They were a nice, easy alternative to rice krispie treats.  My M&M's melted somewhat from the heat of the mixture, making some of the treats messy to handle, but the kids didn't care.   This is a keeper in my \"Toddler-Approved\" cookbook!  ",

I really liked the peanut butter and will add some chopped peanuts as well the next time I make this.  I will also note that the peanut butter does add a slight brown color to these; my husband looked at them and commented how he didn't want to try one because they looked stale.",

Instead of walnuts, I used some slivered almonds that I wanted to use up. After pouring on the glaze, I sprinkled a few more almonds on top. Next time, I think I will make a double batch, as suggested in step 6 - a single batch just disappears too quickly! However, in the directions for making the cocoa glaze, it doesn't say when we're supposed to add the vanilla, so I just added it when I added the butter. Came out fine.",

I made a couple changes as follows:  1)  I used Florida's Crystals Organic Cane Sugar because I was planning to give this to my 27-month old and 12-month old for our 4th of July dessert.  I only give them organic cane sugar as it doesn't promote tooth decay.  2)  I used butter instead of margarine in both the brownies and the glaze.  3)  I used a 9\" square pan and cooked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  That's when the toothpick came out clean.  4)  I did not add nuts unti the very end when putting together my brownie a la mode desserts because I gave this to my 12-month old who is too young for nuts.  5)  For the glaze, I actually made it into more of a real glaze than a frosting.  After adding 2 Tbsp of boiling water, it was still very, very thick.  So. I added 1/3 to 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream.  This made it a nice, runny glaze.  I added half to the top of the brownies while in the pan.  It absorbed into them and made them totally yummy.  I used the other half to pour on top of the final creation.\r\n\r\nThe way I served these was to cut off a brownie and heat it up in the microwave.  I then added a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I topped that with a dollop of the revised glaze I made.  Then, I topped that off with a few chopped walnuts and a dollop of fresh whipped cream.\r\n\r\nFABULOUS DESSERT!  We all went crazy for it!\r\n\r\nThanks for such a simple, quick, AWESOME brownie recipe!",

It has a very mild chocolate flavor, which doesn't really say BROWNIE to me, ya know?\nNot a bad recipe though, It's good in brownie ice cream treats.\nThanks for posting.",

They were most enjoyed but didn't quite have the wow factor that some other brownies I've tried in the past.  Thinking back, it may be that I used margarine as specified and wonder if butter would have made the difference.  Like ladypit, I skipped the frosting and melted a layer of chips on top and dusted with finely chopped walnuts. Made for the I recommend game.",

I did cut in to the brownies while still warm and they didn't cut well, was kind of crumbly but after completely cooled they cut perfectly.

I also added chia and flax seeds, and substituted sucanat for half the sugar.

They are slightly different from box-mix brownies in that they are more rich and less sweet, but they were very chocolatey  and chewy and received raves from the family.<br/><br/>I followed the recipe exactly, without the nuts, because I didn't have any on hand.  When it came to the glaze, I used a fork to poke holes all over the top of the brownies when they came out of the oven, then poured the glaze over the hot brownies.  The glaze soaked into the holes as well as glazing the top and the results were great.  Good thing I made a double batch!",

Brownies are supposed to be moist and chewy, but these were about as far from moist or chewy as you can get. Brownies usually have a good deal of bitterness due to the fact that they&#039;re so chocolatey, but they usually have just enough sweet to balance it out as well. These, however, had absolutely zero sweetness. I&#039;m shocked they have a whole cup of sugar in them. I&#039;m not sure how these have as many good ratings as they do, but please stay FAR away from these &quot;brownies&quot;.",

But I like how this one advises to melt the butter, cocoa and sugar together, doing so it looks exactly the same as melting baker's chocolate with the butter. I will say too about this website in general, I so appreciate when the site is willing to post one star to three star reviews and not omitting them the way so many &quot;food bloggers&quot; do, them only letting the five star reviews through, dishonestly. For this site to be willing to post negative reviews it tells me that the five star reviews are real reviews. Much appreciated!!",

I've enhanced the flavor slightly by using extra virgin olive oil, and a very thin layer of \"original\" style grated parmesan cheese, which melts over the top in the microwave (the lower fat versions of grated parmesan cheese don't seem to melt and are hardly lower in fat!)  To make it even easier, I add canned chicken or tuna to the sauce before cooking.  I make 4 servings according to the recipe, or double it and store the leftovers in the refrigerator.  Very convenient, and above average in flavor.",

      "Review": "This was tasty and very easy to make.  I cut the sugar down to 1 tablespoon, which was enough for us.  I omitted the onions just to save some time. I found the sauce to be a tad salty, only because I eat a low sodium diet.  Next time I will pay closer attention to the sodium in the tomato sauce I purchase, which will eliminate this.  I look forward to making this over and over.  Much less expensive than what I was purchasing in a jar.  Thanks for a great recipe.",

I was skeptical of the amount of sugar, but because of the high reviews, I thought I would simply go by the recipe and see how it turned out.  My family isn't used to sweet spaghetti sauce, so naturally, after tasting it, nobody wanted to eat it.  It was edible though, it might be okay if it were tweaked, but not as is.",

      "Review": "Oct. 1, 2008 This was great! It takes the same time to make as it does to heat the water and boil the noodles. I had a 29 oz. can of tomato sauce so I wasn't sure I wanted to put all of the brown sugar in to start. I used 1 tablespoon and that wasn't enough. After adding a 2nd, that was a tad to sweet. But DD added a sprinkle of salt to hers and said it was better than store bought. I also used half the garlic and basil due to personal taste. DS is super picky and I was a little worried about there being bits of onion in a very smooth sauce but they melted right in after I sauted them first in the olive oil and then added the rest of the ingredients. DH also thought this was better than store bought. This is our new spaghetti sauce. Thanks so much for a easy and great tasting recipe. **I have to add that since I've started making this (almost weekly) I've started to use this as a pizza sauce. I use Recipe #70165. Sometimes if I'm in the mood I'll sprinkle the sauce with a little extra garlic and oregano after I spread it on the dough. I just don't tell the picky people. I'm also making DH learn to cook a few things. This was the first thing. He was truely shocked at how easy it was. He's been known to drive to fast food rather than heat up a plate I've left for him because it was easier so that tells you everything you need to know. Thanks again Junebug!",

I didn't have the time or the patience to bother with an other spaghetti sauce recipe with a million ingredients that took over an hour to prep & cook. I read the measurements wrong and added a 1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder, oregano, basil, parsley, paprika, and forgot to add the bay leaf, and it still came out quite good. I just popped all the ingredients in and let it simmer for 15 mins. At first it was a tad sweet because of the brown sugar, but I added half of a freshly squeezed lemon to the sauce, let it simmer for another 10 mins. and it was perfect. I loved the explosion of flavor, so i think i'll stick to the more generous measurements from now on.  This is an AMAZING recipe that tastes better than any bottled spaghetti sauce I've ever had!",

I use it with spaghetti, meatball subs (turkey meatball subs!), chicken parmigiana, you name it! I always keep the ingredients on hand, as this recipe is the perfect go-to sauce! I've successfully made it in the crock pot for meatballs and it comes out delicious without trying. I have tried different variations, but I do cut the brown sugar by half---it's just too sweet for our tastes with the recommended sugar in the recipe. I've also used Stevia in place of the brown sugar and it has turned out well. I've also subbed out onion powder for the chopped onions for those days in which I'm just too busy to bother. No matter what, this sauce is always a winner! For subs, I like to add a little grated Parmesan to the sauce and it makes it that much better. Thank you for this keeper of a recipe!",

      "Review": "Excellent ponzu sauce.  When I juiced all the fruit up I had over 1 1/2 cups and thought it would be too much for the proportion of sugar.  I used 1 cup.  That was about right, but it could have gone to 1 1/4 just fine.    It didn't taste as much of grapefruit as one would expect.   It just tasted citrusy and had a perfect balance.  For cooks new to caramelizing sugar: do stand back when you put the juice in the saucepan - that pan is mighty hot.   I used flathead fillets for the fish.  Nice combination.",

When it was finished, I put it in a 200 degree oven until the sauce was ready with no ill effects.  I wouldn't do this for too long though.  I served this with rice to sop up some of the extra sauce.  I think that a cilantro garnish might add a nice touch, too.",

I decided to sear the salmon under the broiler after very lightly misting the first side with a mixture of sesame and sunflower oil. Garnishes of shiso leaf, shredded rated carrot, and julienned pickled kelp.  Love citrus fruit and mandarins are already on the market. They are little jewels when used as supremes. Some steamed 'Rose' rice on the side. DEElish. Thanks, Meanie...",

      "Review": "My husband and I both thought this sauce was superb! And your cooking instructions for the salmon were perfect. I got a beautiful golden crust, although I did shave off about a minute from the cooking time on each side, just for our taste. I cut the recipe in half - 2 fillets and half of the sauce which amounted to about 1/2 cup! Do be careful when you add the fruit juices to the browning sugar. It bubbles furiously, and part of my sugar actually turned solid when the juice hit it. But I worked it through with a wooden spoon, and it eventually blended back in. Whew! I also left the zest in the ponzu.",

I used salmon filets, baked in aluminum foil packets with a dribble of olive oil and salt, and then plated it over the sauce, dribbled some sauce on top and garnished with additional zest.

There is already plenty of sugar in the recipe, but my fruit probably could have been riper.  So I suggest you adjust the sugar depending upon the ripeness of the fruit.  I'll definitely make again and tweak to my liking.  Served with steamed rice and braised baby bok choy.",

      "Review": "First off, I have to say that I don't like fish. I bought some salmon because I know it's good for me, but I didn't really like it the first time I prepared it. I decided it needed some strong flavors to accompany it and so I found this recipe. It is easy, quick, and I really enjoyed it!! I didn't think I would be buying salmon again, but we discussed having this meal again while we were eating last night. I was afraid there would be too much soy sauce, but I made the recipe exactly how it's written, and it turned out beautifully. I loved the \"crust\" on the salmon, it created a great mouthfeel (which is a reason I think I don't like fish--it's too soft feeling). I was afraid that just salting would make it bland, but with the sauce, it was perfect. I didn't \"puddle\" the sauce on the plate, but served it in tiny bowls on the side so we could dip as much or as little as we wanted. Thanks Mooseybear!!",

      "Review": "Very good, very simple and healthy way to make zucchini. I used egg substitute, garlic powder, 1/2 breadcrumbs, 1/2 panko and I baked them a little longer than the recipe stated. The difference in texture with the panko and breadcrumbs was nice. My DH doesn't really like zucchini but he said they were very good and that i should make them again! Only downside it that you have to eat them fresh out of the over because they get soft rather quickly.",

      "Review": "These were really quick to make! I added garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture, although I'll probably switch the fresh garlic from the egg mixture to the breadcrumb mixture next time. The zucchini came out next and crispy. I forgot to add the fresh parsley, and only had regular breadcrumbs, so I was missing some seasoning, but I'll definitely try this again the right way. Thanks!",

      "Review": "AND another great recipe!!!  I did these tonight along with your Zresty Oven Baked Fries.  As much as I enjoyed the fries (and will be making them lots in the future), these zucchini chips were HEAVEN!!!  I have a zucchini left in the fridge and am seriously thinking that I may just sneak back in the kitchen and whip up another batch!!!  I order the fried zucchini in restaurants a lot -- but these top ANY I have had.  I did find that I needed to bake them a bit longer -- but maybe that was because I had other things going on in the oven at the same time.  We used the ranch dressing -- low fat, low cal.  With all the flavor the chips had -- we didn't even notice that the dressing was \"diet friendly\".   I really encourage others to try this recipe.  I'm going to post it on the inside of my cupboard door -- because I know it's gonna be used so often.  Yummy, yum, yum!!!",

It was a little time consuming though, and I must have been using bigger zucchinis than average, because I ended up having to make twice or three times as much dry breading. PS   it really tastes great if you let the garlic sit in the egg overnight, or as long as possible!",

I was so pleased with how these turned out. Served with breaded baked pork chops and corn. I did have to let them cook a bit longer to get browned, but it's much easier than standing over hot oil...making sure to turn at precisely the right moment...trying not to splash yourself.

The only two things I revised was baking first layer for 15 minutes & let cool prior to putting the second layer on.  I only added 1 1/4 cups of icing sugar as the chocolate layer is sweet enough.

This base is  a bit more moist and has more of the middle layer. I did replace 1/2 cup coconut with unsweetened coconut but that is just a personal taste. My copy has now been replaced with your version. The holidays just wouldn't be the same with the Nanaimo bar not on that goodie tray.",

It didn't turn out as well as I expected so I'm not too sure what I did wrong :( I found the bottom layer to be a bit dry and subsequently crumbly. I only had an 8x8 pan available so I did my best to make everything even, and save a bit from each layer so it wouldn't be too thick. The middle layer was delicious, as usual. And a warning to everyone - heat the chocolate (I recommend using real chocolate, not chocolate chips), very slowly!! Also, after your squares have been made, sit them out for a bit and cut them before the chocolate top is completely hardened, but not while it is too soft that it's still runny!",

      "Review": "(Â¯`Â·._)â™¦These are very good. My husband and son enjoyed them. I happen to have had one of these delectables the other day and thought I would try my hand at it. I found that in the base (bottom) if I used real butter and mixed everything while it was still hot, it did not seem to be crumby, as a few people have said. I mixed it past the crumbly stage, so it was almost a dough.. and when I patted it out, it was almost like a brownie. I place in the fridge for about a half hour then used a very sharp thin knife with a straight edge, keeping it on an angle, it did not break or crack the top. The center set up nicely, the top was very easy. (used the double boiler method, as you do with the bottom) The recipe was straightforward and fairly easy to concoct. Very rich, which is a good thing, because you can keep portions small, and still feel satisfied. Thanks for a great recipe, I am sure I will use this again.â™¦(_.Â·Â´Â¯)",

Fill the glass 3/4 full with large cut strawberries and top with a huge dollup of the Romanoff sauce.  Also looks beautiful in a sturdy Martini glass if you don't have the other.

I have been dying for these and la madeleine is just two expensive for that tiny glass and they never give you enough sauce.  I made it with vanilla and it still tasted amazing.  I used organic cream that was practically whipped by the time I took it out the carton (it was the good stuff), it made the fluffiest whip cream I have ever had.  Horizon doesn't even come close.  I added a touch of cinnamon and a pinch of salt to add a depth to the flavor.  I even used my little mini bullet processor to whip the cream (just add the sugar in from the beginning).  This recipe is amazing.  I will now live a happier life. :)",

      "Review": "I was looking for something quick and easy to do with frozen cooked shrimp and firm tofu, and this was perfect! I had fresh green onions and even fresh ginger on hand. The only substitutions I made was for the hoisin sauce since I didn't have any. I used House of Tsang Bangkok Peanut Sauce and skipped the sugar and red pepper flakes since it's somewhat sweet and spicy already. I used about a tsp and a half of fresh ginger. I also used about twice as much fresh garlic I thin just because I was in a hurry and not reading carefully. In any case, it was delicious. I thawed the precooked shrimp in running water, removed tails and let them drain well while making the sauce and sauteeing the tofu. Thanks for such an ideal recipe!",

I was surprised that it didn't taste too salty, either, since I usually find that with the canned soups (used regular beef broth and Healthy Choice  Mushroom soup). This made our dinner really special. I am already thinking turkey broth to make a turkey gravy, too. Thanks Packer Backer Pammy.",

The fresh lime would have made a difference.  I didn't shake and strain, because I prefer having a chunk of ice in the glass.  The only thing that would improve this is to have a little cup with better ounces on the side.  I ended up using a shot glass and eyeballing the \"1/2 oz.\" mark.

      "Review": "I have been intrigued by this recipe ever since I spotted it among the RSC entries.  I finally had an opportunity to make it today to serve with a salad & cup of soup.  I must say I had some problems with the recipe.  First coriander seeds are listed twice in the ingredient list.  Then the curry powder isn’t mentioned in the instructions.  I also found step #7 a little confusing.  I followed the ingredient list only using the coriander seeds once & did add the curry powder.  My biggest problem was in rolling these babies up...the phyllo tended to tear easily.  After the first two, I started using two sheets brushed with butter per cigar.  They were much easier to roll & I actually preferred the crunchiness of them to the ones only having one sheet of phyllo.  They are unusual & I think by adjusting the spices slightly, something I would really like.   I think the spice combos one could come up with are endless.  I will look forward to experimenting & matching to different menus.    Thank you for sparking my imagination & I compliment you on an interesting contest idea.  \r\n\r\n",

I cooked the chicken & onion till nearly fully caramelized, so the recipe was joined by the lovely browned pan juices. The use of Dijon & honey took the flavor out of the ordinary.

      "Review": "This did not work for me. I stirred the sugar and water for at least 30 minutes before anything happened. Eventually all the liquid evaporated and the sugar started to harden. I soldiered on with the rest of the recipe and the sauce ended up with pea size nuggets of hard sugar in it. I just strained those out and the remaining sauce tastes ok but it sure wasn't pretty getting there. I am not a novice cook but I somehow botched this recipe.",

      "Review": "Although I only had boneless skinless breasts, the combinations of seasonings made this too tempting to resist.  I cut the amount of meat and oil in half but the stated quantity of the other indgredients.  To keep the chicken moist, I burried them under the other stuff.  After 45 minutes the chicken was perfect, so I removed it and allow the veggies to go another 22 minutes.  The flavors were just great and the lemon and spices reduced to an amazing slightly brown sauce. No bread here so I was forced to use my finger. Thanks Mama!!!!",

Gotta love a good recipe that is easy to clean up afterwards!!! Oh, almost forgot, it was delicous! I did take the chicken out and let the veggies cook a bit longer and then i simply replaced the chicken and let it warm up before serving. I used a red pepper instead of green and fresh oregano instead of dried.... followed the rest exactly.

      "Review": "Mama, This was amazing! I made this the other night and it was a HUGE hit. I did as you suggested by doubling the sauce ingredients. I put my veggies in one stoneware dish and my chicken in another and basted both every 15 minutes. I used bone in and skin on, chicken breasts. I did omit the peppers since my husband is not a big fan of bell peppers of any color and used sweet vidalia onions instead of red since that was what I had on hand. I also added a few whole cloves of garlic with the vegetables (I love roasted garlic of any flavor and these were great with their bit of lemon taste and also worked perfectly spread on bread!). Those were the only things that I did differently. Other than that this recipe is perfect as written. Oh MY!!! Truly wonderful tasting and very pleasing to the eye. Thank you again Mama for helping me create something that will now be on my permanent list of favorite dishes. Hugs, Susie",

My husband gave this 3.5 stars but doesn't rate recipes according to fat/health factor.  He's giving this 3.5 compared to ALL recipes which is unfair since this is so healthy and tastes wonderful.  That being said, from a health/taste standpoint, this one is 5 stars all the way!  Thanks for another great one mama!  We all loved it!",

I doubled the lemon, used fresh oregano, and used more onion rather than add the mushrooms and pepper. We loved the veggie portion of this - so lemony. Like other reviewers, I also used more and whole cloves of garlic (8 for the half recipe); it was really yummy having the roasted garlic in it.

I used a lot less bread for the stuffing and added a little fresh parsley and thyme, plus salt and pepper while using less sage (I didn't use fresh).  I also sprinkled salt and pepper on the turkey before roasting.  The instructions are excellent and it came out fabulous.  I did defrost my turkey in the fridge for 4 days ahead of time.  Thanks for posting!",

The rating is a group rating for all 8 of us!\r\nI have never made paella, so I was a little nervous, but there was no need to be!\r\nI used whole chicken legs for the rabbit. It couldn't have been easier, and the entire recipe fit into a 12\" round, 3\" deep stove top pan. It needs to spread out rather than be in a stock pot. Otherwise it would become very sticky. I used Spanish rice (regular grocer!) and made the recipe as written.\r\nI don't know much about saffron. It was QUITE expensive, but I did use it. (Don't know whether it was worth it, because I haven't made it without!)",

I did mine in in an enameled dutch oven on the stove top.  I ended up burning it badly to the bottom of the pan, so next time I will use lower heat and cook longer if necessary.  I also might add the green beans later on (I added them towards the beginning).  I left out the rabbit and chicken, and I used dried Thyme because fresh wasn't available.  I also used bouillon with the added herbs.  It still turned out great.  It must be even better if you follow the directions exactly.",

Once you have all the meats cooked, veggies saut&eacute;ed, and everything added back into the pan, there's still 30-45 minutes of cooking and resting to be done. I plan 2+ hours to make this dish, including chopping veggies, but I have small kids under foot, so your time may be shorter. Also, I keep forgetting that shrimp isn't considered mate in this recipe. Don't add the shrimp with the other meats. It cooks at the very end. Our family of 5 eats this entire pan in one sitting. I suggest making 2 pans and having leftovers the next day.",

I'm also going to add a chopped, seedless jalape&ntilde;o and a dash of chipotle powder to give it some kick. I would have followed it to the letter, but when my wife told me not to use rabbit as we're serving it to guests, I decided to substitute the meat ingredients. I'm also using bomba rice, which is, as I was told, the right rice to use.",

      "Review": "Very good! We all liked it, and it satisfied my craving for big macs! I did make some changes: I used Recipe #215010 in lieu of bottled dressing, used a mix of about 1 part mozzarella cheese to about 4 parts cheddar cheese, skipped the bacon, tomatoes, and mustard (since big macs don't have those ingredients), and added some finely chopped onion (since big macs do have onion). I spread the dressing over the partially baked crust, topped with the beef, then the cheese, and finally the onion, baked at 400 F for 5 minutes, then topped with dill pickle chips and shredded iceberg lettuce. In future, I will only add the pickles and lettuce to the servings, as they get warm and limp (and won't reheat well!). I think I might sprinkle on some sesame seeds next time, too.

There were a few changes due to the insistance of my almost-six-year old who helped: no hot pepper sauce or olives and she tipped the ham mixture into the egg mixture before I could tell her that it wasn't meant to be that way and was stirring furiously (I had evidence on the kitchen walls to prove it LOL. So into the oven they went.... and even with the kid friendly omissions, tasted great.. DH demolished everything on the plate in the photo as we had this as a side dish for dinner and mentioned that they were good. My only problem: DO grease the muffin cups really well as I had problems coaxing all of mine out and a few weren't whole enough after my efforts to make the photograph. Please see my rating system: 4 great stars for a tasty recipe that definiately found favour at our place. My photo's tonight were sadly not co operative, without flash seems too yellow and with flash.. well I let you choose,  I personally think Marlene's should stand as the default. Thanks!",

Since I was in no mood to clean up the oven of burnt cake I put a piece of parchment paper under the pan. If it should overflow, at least my oven would be clean. But I shouldn't have worried, the pan was the right size for the cake. Yes it rose, but not a crumble overflowed.\r\nIt baked in exactly 55 minutes.

Well today I had a late day and didnt have to be out until 7am so I decided to make breakfast. If I could only show you the look on my moms face when a REAL breakfast was on the table for us! Little does she know it took 15 minutes to have this made plus toast and coffee with fresh fruit! This is such a quick and easy meal idea I think I would make on my early mornings too. I threw in some left over cooked ham to make it a bit more hearty. Many possibilies to work with. Made for PAC 07 with GREAT results!!",

I would like to say that for anyone to heat up an oven(unless it's a toaster oven) to prepare this for any less than SIX people...OK, maybe 4....is about as big a conspicuous display of energy as anything I can imagine.  PLEASE, folks.  I encourage all to try this delicious dish.  But, to do so for \"one or two\" is WASTEFUL to the nth degree!  For your family, or several friends, go for it.  Otherwise enjoy it in a hotel, B&B, or restaurant. The recipe is glorious, but not for \"one\".  Enjoy!",

I know now the necessary adjustments and will try this at least one more time. I have no idea how someone could cook an egg for thirty minutes at 350 without it burning completely. Anyway my suggestion would be to check it at about 12 minutes and watch it carefully after that. And to take it out just before you think it is done and let it set, the remaining heat will do that for you!",

I learned from my father to add or delete what appeals to my taste buds and seldom did he, or I measure anything. Iin other words food always taste amazing, but very seldom does a recipe taste the same, (always excellent ) never the same This recipe was very good, it does continue to cook after it is taken out of the oven so next time I will not cook over 13 minutes.",

Solved that problem by adding a can of frozen pink lemonade after draining off most of the syrup from the frozen lemon pulp.  Used wine (pino grigio) instead of water.  It was a little funky colored due to the pink lemonade, but added a few drops yellow and pink food coloring when it was all cooked until the color mellowed out.  This set nicely and made 12 4-oz. jars and 1 little dish for my fridge.  Really nice tart/sweet taste, even hubby liked it and he's not a jam fan.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Thought I did not like this type of food but I am finding lots of things that are just delicious! I sub'd whole spices here for the coriander and nutmeg as that is what I had.  Thanks Charlotte!",

They also were fairly wet in the center on the first day, but much improved by the second day. I am not sure if that is because the amount of cherries is too much or if they needed to bake longer (I baked them 21 minutes, and the toothpick did come out clean). I used less sugar and topped them with sliced almonds. Thanks, Kree!",

I replaced vanilla with almond extract (didn't have any) and it was just fine. They were nice. A good way to use up some cherries and showcase them in a dish that doesn't require more than 1 cup!",

Only changes I&#039;ll make are to cut the almond extract by half (and I&#039;m generally a huge fan of almond flavor) and just to make them  healthier I will omit some of the sugar. Sliced almonds would be a nice addition, as another reviewer said. I added flax seed and used almond milk soured with lemon juice. The edges browned quickly but I left the muffins in the oven since the center wasn&#039;t cooked (total 17 minutes); thankfully the edges didn&#039;t taste dry or overcooked.",

It was so tender, there was nothing to do but shred it up.  Next time I may just try all day on low as I am usually not here to switch from high to low; I don't think it would hurt at all.

But I'm proud of the fact that I can eyeball a recipe I've never made before and just know if it's going to be a good one or not.  And this one is not good, it's GREAT!  I adore ginger cookies, and these are lovely.  Not too hard, but just enough to be quintessential ginger cookies.  I didn't have any ground cloves (I never do) so I just subbed some nutmeg and allspice (didn't measure).  This recipe makes quite a lot of cookies, which have found a home in my freezer.  I take one out to have with my cup of tea when I come home from a day at the office.  And they're good frozen, too, if you like to gnaw.  This recipe was perfect for me as well, as I usually work in metric, but hate to weigh flour.  Thanks Zee, this feeds my ginger addiction!",

I didn't have quite enough sour cream, so I added a dab of mayonnaise to top it off.  I also used cheddar cheese-- we're in the middle of a blizzard, so I had to go with what was on hand :)  Thanks for a keeper!",

I really liked the idea of this dish and the flavors it offered, but the change I made the second time around was kind of drastic, so I ended up with 3 stars.  I added chicken the first time around to make it a heartier meal (rather than a side dish), and will do that again.  The sour cream kind of curdled when I baked the dish, which was not really pleasant to look at.  I don't know if that's specific to me or not... The second time I made this dish I used  3 or 4 ounces of cream cheese (and heated it up with the diced tomatoes to create a sauce).  To retrieve the lime flavor, I marinated the chicken in lime juice for an hour or so, which I liked better.  Thank you for your southwestern flavor inspiration!",

The sour cream curdled, which made the texture kind of weird, and I didn't think the tortellini really went that well in the dish. If I had this to do again, I would probably just use macaroni noodles, and then serve the sour cream mixture on the side. And maybe reduce the lime a little bit. Thanks for a good idea though!",

I doubled the recipe and split it between two baking dishes, and eliminated the olives and substituted parsley for the cilantro. I also used the Chicken &amp; Herb tortellini for a bit more protein. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, and I applaud Parsley for posting this. The lime cuts through most of the ingredients to give this dish a fresh taste.",

I love popovers, and this is the only recipe I&#039;ve found that allows the addition of cheese and then actually &quot;pops over&quot;.  I added about 1/2 tsp melted butter to each of my 6 non-stick popover cups, and I used about 1 tsp of smoked cheddar in each.  They were delicious!  Tip - promptly remove the popovers from the pan after baking, to avoid moisture building up in the pan, causing your popovers to get soggy - then poke a hole in each one to release the steam.  The popovers will be crisp on the outside and moist (but not wet) on the inside.  Perfection!",

      "Review": "I found the measurements confusing, too... I did my best with them, though, and I think I got pretty close, but the batter was still very thick.  Muffin batter should be more liquid -- this was more like a drop cookie batter.  I got six muffins out of this recipe, and it baked for fifteen minutes before I took them out of the oven.  They weren't browned, but Splenda doesn't caramelize the way sugar does, so they probably won't brown the way you'd expect.  Still, they were a little heavy.  I'd try this recipe again, but increase the liquids some and add a bit of spice because the taste was a little bland.  It's a good starter recipe, though -- thanks for posting.",

      "Review": "I can't believe this one hasn't been made and commented on yet. It was absolutely gorgeous. I live in France and we get duck magret really cheap. So I cook duck at least once a week. You can imagine  how many different ways and sauces I have paired with it, so it has to be something a little bit better for me to give it a 5 star rating. This had that, the flavours worked really well and no one had leftovers on their plates. I didn't bother with boiling the veg first, I find they cook just fine from start to finish in a wok. I also had to up the ingredients for sauce to glaze the duck, as in my non stick pan it just wanted to fall to the sides rather than covering the bottom of the pan. Also you mention balsamic vinegar in your steps to make glaze, but not the amount in the ingredients. I used 1 Tablespoon. Apart from those couple of things, this was delicious and will become a regular at our table, thanks for sharing.",

I aso added 2 tsp. banana extract flavor (just in case the overripe,black bananas were not banany tasting enough)- I put 1 C walnuts in it also and it turned out nice and moist.I did ice it also with a simple powdered sugar,butter,vanilla,milk icing.really good with a glass of milk or a cup of coffee.Honestly I cant stand when people doa review and change everything but I was of the mindset of trying to tweak it just right - and I think I did! just that&lt;br/&gt;!",

I made this following the directions - minus the onion because I didn't have one and with regular rice instead of instant. I allowed it to simmer 22 minutes instead of 5 and the rice was fully cooked. I also added some left over rice from the night before (heated before added). Before adding the cheese I put the food into a 9x13 baking dish. After I added the cheese I put it in the oven @ 375 for about 5 minutes. The cheese was melted and nice & stringy.  <br/><br/>I agree that it needs a little kick or spice to it, especially because when you hear or read \"Fiesta\" in a dish you think of course about Mexican food - but I also think of spicy. I had read the previous reviews and opted to not add additional spices because I wanted to taste for myself what it needed. I think red pepper flakes might do the trick.",

I did opt not to include the brandy since, nowadays I only use liquor in recipes that allow the alcohol to be burned off during cooking, so . . . Must admit that I enjoyed the salad, too, as I thought the flavor of any artichokes was pretty much nicely overtaken by the other flavors ~ All to the good, in my book!

      "Review": "Well, this sure was a hit! The flavors are so complex and harmonious, yet this was simple to make. I subbed extra zucchini for the eggplant, and canned roma tomatoes. After using 1 tsp dried basil, I remembered the fresh basil in my fridge and added a Tbsp of that. I used 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar instead of wine. Finally, I reduced the salt to 1/8 tsp and didn't even find it needed any more. My dad, for one, would give it more than 5 stars. He said it was like restaurant food and wants to take it for a potluck. Thanks so much, Sharon! Made for Please Review tag.",

The orecchiette is a very substantial pasta, so substituting sea shells in place of it is not advised for those that can't find it. Rotini or rigatoni might work...something thick and beefy.

I prefer using hot Italian sausage and it was not spicy because the mascarpone tamed any heat, so don&#039;t be afraid to try it. I used 1 teaspoon of dried oregano instead of fresh, worked perfectly. Be sure to use the orecchietta pasta because truly nothing compares.  Thank you for posting.",

Even DH said, \"mmmm soo good, you should make more.\"\nI got a bit confused with the orange being sectioned and chopped though, if each section has to be individually peeled. Next time I should also make sure to seal them properly since some peeked out a bit. But even with that, they still look appetizing, bringing it a bit of style. Thanks,HokiesLady!",

      "Review": "The story pulled me in, I have to admit. After all, what kind of troop leader would I be if I didn't make this adorable Girl Scout recipe? I sectioned the oranges, then peeled them. This made it easier to get the membrane off. Instead of throwing out the sugared orange juice that is drained, I used it for the juice called for in the glaze. It made it a bit sweeter, but still very good and fresh tasting. I also had a problem with them peeking out a bit, but that is user error on my part. I've never been very good working with dough. The first rise didn't produce very skyhigh results, but my kitchen is a little cold. I let them rise a bit longer on the second rise and they did just fine. The flavor is very good in the bread and the glaze. I chopped up the zest a little too, just so I didn't have long stringy pieces. All around great recipe and story. This recipe has been added to my Girl Scout cookbook too. Made and Reviewed for 123 Hit Wonders Tag - Thanks! :)",

I added 2 cups of Hunt's Garlic & Herb Spaghetti Sauce, and because the sauce has herbs in it, I only added a 1/2 tsp. of the Italian seasoning mix.  As for the red pepper flakes, I added 1/4 tsp., as we like our dishes a bit on the spicy side.  Also topped each serving with a bit of grated Parmesan cheese, which made this hot dish taste even better.\r\n\"Thank you\" Brandess for this recipe, it was good, comfort food.",

Let it sit for about 2 mins ate it warm with milk.  DH and I were in dessert heaven.  already thinking of so many variations.  Apple spice, coffee, mint.  Once the basic recipe is figured out, then it is easy to make some wonderful variations.\nThanks again  Judy in WA\nOct 1/08 update:  I have tried many variations.  They are very good, but more like a steamed pudding, so quite moist and not as cake-like\n\n9/5  Update.  I tried one of my revisions that I suggested:  Apple spice: chopped fine 1/2 apple, Whey Low brown sugar (always use Whey Low) cinnamon, ginger, cloves nutmeg to DH taste.  also replaced 2 tbsp cocoa wit 2tbsp  flour.  Spice Cake is one of DH favs and he loved it.  Just came across diabetic version on Zaar as well; it is just about the same. \nTake care and happy cooking\nJudy",

      "Review": "Another chef stated that this tastes more like a steamed pudding than cake. That's exactly right (and might be a more apt title for this recipe). A good thing if steamed pudding is your thing, but not if you really want to eat chocolate CAKE. The texture is extremely dense, and there is no \"crumb\" to it.  I threw more than half away, and only ate whatever I did because I was really desperate for something sweet. (Ps. I followed the recipe to the letter)",

      "Review": "This is too darn good! Instead of using one mug, I used two standard size coffee cups because the recipe is enough for two people to have a nice size treat. Course, I live alone, so I ate the second one because the first one was so delicious! I sprayed the inside of the cups with PAM and nuked them 3 mins together. I sprinkled top with toasted coconut - one could add nuts or raisins, too. Has that rich taste you can only get from cocoa powder. Mmmmm! Instant gratification! What a great addition to my bag of tricks! Thanks!",

      "Review": "Wow...I had not seen the emails regarding this recipe, but this recipe is AWESOME. I live alone and often get a craving for chocolate cake or brownies. I end up make a whole cake or a whole batch of brownies, and if I don't take 3/4 of it to work, it gets wasted. I only have a 700 watt microwave, so I had to cook it for 3-1/2 minutes. The cake turned out perfectly. It was nice and moist. I drizzled some chocolate syrup over it and then topped it off with some whipped cream. Mmmmmmm...I was in chocolate heaven. This would also be great with some vanilla ice cream. I can see why you would have to use a large mug. I did use a large mug and the cake puffed up to about 1/2 inch taller than the mug, but once the microwave shut off the cake ended up filling the mug about 3/4 full. This recipe is going straight into my keeper file. Thanks for sharing, Zurie. Made for March, 2009 Photo Tag.  Update:  This recipe is in my Top Favorites of 2009 Cookbook.",

      "Review": "It's magic all right. But as with all magic it's just an illusion. <br/>Frankly this recipe... I wouldn't suggest it or make it again.<br/>And definitely only make one at a time.<br/>First off You MUST use cake flour. You cannot substitute it at all. <br/>Secondly: The liquid to dry ratio is completely off. I could tell from the batter which seemed to slide like milk off a spoon. It should be a little thicker than that. But this is definitely a SPONGECAKE if anything. <br/>The leavening is a little strong, you can heavily taste the baking powder as an after taste.<br/>Big suggestion: Mix everything at once. Mixing seperate parts (like dry and egg) makes it harder to mix and uneven. It causes a lot of clumps.<br/><br/>BIG suggestion to those who don't think it's chocolatey enough: use Nesquick, not baking cocoa powders. The extra milk and sugar compounds in Nesquick help the chocolatey flavor.<br/><br/>However, even with altering the recipe, I don't know if this will work.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I would not suggest it again.",

      "Review": "This cake is NOT a replacement for chocolate cake, or brownies. However, when it is late at night and you want a dessert, have nothing in the pantry, but actually seem to have the ingredients to make this, I think it is worth a shot. Just don't go into this thinking you are going to get a rich, fudgy & decadent dessert. I made this 2 nights in a row, because hubby and I wanted dessert, it was late, and we had no sweets around. The first night I doubled the recipe and used our largest mugs, and the cakes were soooo huge, they were too much for us. The 2nd night, I made the regular recipe, divided it among 2 normal sized mugs, and it was a perfect serving size. The larger mugs I cooked for 1 minute & 25 seconds each (separately). The smaller mugs, I cooked for 1 minute and they were done perfectly. I also threw in some chocolate chips before cooking, without stirring them in. They kind of sink to the middle of the cake, and when you stick your fork in it, you get sort of a nice lava cake effect. So if you are hungry in the middle of the night and HAVE to have a sweet, this might do it for you. I tumped it out on a plate and sprinkled over some powdered sugar, and it worked fine for us.",

I added a handful of semi sweet chips and used buttermilk and coconut oil instead of the milk and oil. It could benefit from some chocolate sauce to make it a bit richer, though. I cooked mine for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, closer to only 2 minutes would have probably made it a little more moist and fudgey. I used an over-sized tea mug and this recipe filled it up all the way to the top, perhaps those with standard mugs might want to split this recipe between two mugs. Overall, give it a try if you&#039;re looking for a quick chocolate fix.",

      "Review": "You are right Zurie the reviews are all over the board on this one. It is a quick and easy last minute sweet that is ok but not great. I made using whole wheat and cutting the milk a bit as suggested by another reviewer, also used dark cocoa and increased the sugar just a smidge as we like things sweet and several reviewers stated it was not sweet enough, topped with some chocolate chips instead of powdered sugar. This made a full ten ounce dessert that was more than enough for DH and I to share. Thanks for the post.",

      "Review": "I didn&#039;t have cake flour so I just added a big pinch of corn starch to the flour and mixed before adding the other dry ingredients.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked for 2.5 minutes and cake rose nicely.  It wasn&#039;t super sweet or overly chocolaty, but I don&#039;t like my desserts to be overly sweet.  I sprinkled powered sugar over the top and it was the perfect thing to satisfy my sweet craving. The texture wasn&#039;t like a normal cake but I didn&#039;t find it rubbery either. So far, I found this to be the best mug cake recipe.  Will experiment with adding some instant coffee next time to pump up the flavor.",

      "Review": "I’ve tried a few chocolate mug cakes with unhappy results, but this one was considerably better! We made some substitutions to reduce the carbs since I’m diabetic. We used garbanzo flour, almond milk, and the only oil on hand was evoo. For sweetness, we used 1 T of Demerara sugar and 3 Truvia packets. To add fiber, we put in some chopped pecans, and for moistness we added 4 small chocolate truffles which added 13 carbs. Btw, the garbanzo flour added just 10 net carbs! There was quite a bit of cake mix, probably enough for 2 regular sized mugs, but we used one huge one, otherwise it most likely would’ve run over! Two and a half minutes later, we had something reminiscent of a slightly dry chocolate cake. The texture was much better than previous recipes. It wasn’t airy and spongey like past attempts. Unfortunately, except for the parts where the truffles melted, it was kind of bland, with a rather anemic chocolate taste. My partner, otoh, thought it was very good. Personally, I’m beginning to think that all these years after the introduction of the consumer microwave, it’s still best suited to softening butter, boiling water and heating up leftovers right on the dinner plate. But I digress. Despite the shortcomings of the microwave mug cakes, it’s still kinda fun to make them, and this one was the best yet!",

I love the usage of jalapenos from the jar because they are usually in vinegar so they create a wonderful flavor in this chili!  I put in just 1/2 tsp ground cumin because I like cumin as a subtle flavor and I drained the beans only slightly.  I will definitely make this again and again!!  So easy to make yet tastes like it took a lot more work.  Love this recipe, thank you for posting and thanks to Jason!!!!  Made for the Tex-Mex photo challenge, November 2008.",

      "Review": "Jason-I am going to have to give your recipe a perfect rating because it is almost identical to  the one I came up with after reviewing dozens of recipes and deciding  which  flavors and combinations of- would work  for me. This is  such a fun recipe to play with. Just like  (Red) Chili  you can improvise all over the place.  I  like to call this my perfect pantry meal because I  never get tired of it and I can keep all of the main ingredients in the pantry  (using canned chicken meat, canned (undrained)beans,  canned or  boxed broth ,canned green chiles,garlic and onion sauteed in Olive Oil and some spices) and  make a  wonderful   meal in  less than 20 minutes! The  last few times I have made it I have  skipped the  jalapenos and used one  (canned) Chipotle Pepper and some Adobo Sauce(since that stuff is always in my refrigerator). Sometimes instead of  cheese I  top mine with  sour cream and maybe a few chopped chives or scallions.  If I don't  use the Chipotle I  usually add  a  pinch of ground cloves which gives it an added dimension. PS-would you believe my DH tells everyone I don't  cook? Truth is  he usually does the cooking and  he cooks  is fairly  bland food. When he isn't around I chow down on   Real Spicy Food! Also- I did not realise how much I like cumin til I started making this and now I use it a lot. I came up with a killer recipe for  After Thanksgiving Turkey Soup using   cumin which is now a  wonderful soul food/tradition for me!",

Many compliments, three people asked for the recipe, and not a drop was left.<br/><br/>Poached 4 very large bone-in split chicken breast halves the night before (removed skin first), which yielded 7 cups of cut-up chicken, and then followed Jason's instructions using the following amounts:<br/><br/>1 very large white onion, chopped<br/>7 garlic cloves, crushed<br/>About 18 sliced mild jalapeno peppers from a jar, chopped<br/>2 4-oz. cans chopped green chili peppers<br/>4 t. cumin<br/>2 t. oregano<br/>1 t. cayenne pepper<br/>Between 2 and 3 cans chicken broth (start with 2 and add more for a less thick chili).<br/>7 cups chopped cooked chicken breasts<br/>3 15-oz cans white Northern beans, drained and rinsed.<br/>I also added 4 T. lime juice (from fresh limes).<br/><br/>Garnishes: sour cream and shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar/Jack cheese.<br/><br/>The only ingredients I didn't double were the beans, broth and cayenne. This was a beany chili even with only 3 cans, and fewer beans means less broth is needed for a thick chili. (Next time I may try 1 can Rotel tomatoes in place of the 2 small cans of green chilis.)",

Halfway through the baking time, I lightly flattened them with a spatula, so they would bake more evenly, but still have a beautiful crackly top.  These are gorgeous cookies and would make a wonderful bake sale item or gift.",

      "Review": "Very good! I used a 10 oz bag of Reese&#039;s baking candy pieces which didn&#039;t combine with the dough very well, mostly ending up at the bottom of the mixing bowl and needing to be pressed into the dough balls by hand. Next time I&#039;d use regular Reese&#039;s pieces candies, peanut butter chips, or chocolate chips. Rolled into balls and mashed with a fork after reading reviews that the cookies didn&#039;t spread. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

      "Review": "As another reviewer I found that I had to add a substantial amount of flour to make a manageable dough. I think that&#039;s the reason why the taste is a little light on the salt. Next time, I will use a full teaspoon of salt or even more. The flavor of molasses is not overwhelming which is good. I actually let the dough rise for a full two hours on the first rise which worked out great. I got two loaves from this recipe. Some of the oats on top got a little bit crunchy but the rest of the bread is nice and soft with a little bit of bite from the oats. I am curious how well this will freeze. All in all a very nice recipe.",

I followed the recipe except I used 1 cup King Arthur 100% whole grain whole wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached bread flour, and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon brown sugar, 1 cup raisins and 1 cup chopped toasted walnuts (based on prior reviewer suggestion). The dough was somewhat sticky but manageable without adding extra flour. I kneaded it on the counter, gave it extra time to rise and formed one heavy loaf. I'm going to make it again using dried cherries instead of raisins, and then will try dried dates and then dried apples. Thank you for this recipe!",

      "Review": "I've made this recipe twice now, both with 4 cups, and with 2 cups of water- the 2 cups seems to work better as it makes for a richer broth, and you can always add more as needed.  My differences were as follows:   When I made it was green bell pepper, and I sauteed the veggies first before then adding the meat.  I used an actual tomato (about medium/large), plus the tomato puree/sauce.  The tomato was added along with the spices and water to stew.  If you want to tone it down on the spice factor (I had to for my wife), you can use 1/2 tbsp sweet, 1/2 tbsp hot Hungarian paprika.  I love the hot version though, the taste can't be beat.<br/><br/>The type of meat I used was boneless pork ribs, about 1.5-2 lbs both times- the amount of fat is just right, and they fall apart even with a spoon.  <br/><br/>This was my first Hungarian recipe I tried, and now I am hooked!",

      "Review": "I see where you&#039;ve made changes and I think you&#039;ve made excellent ones that are actually attempts to go back in time to older recipes.  For example, using tomato sauce.  In old Hungarian recipes, you might see lecso there because people would know that if it&#039;s summer, you just use a lot of onions, green pepper and tomatoes and cook them down first, then you proceed with cooking, but if it&#039;s winter, you use lecso.  In today&#039;s busy lifestyle, it&#039;s faster to just make lecso ahead of time (food.com has a &quot;Letcho&quot; recipe that&#039;s good), and keep some frozen for the purpose.  So I like your modifications, they&#039;re actually throwbacks and make a lot of sense.  The cumin is interesting.  Caraway is the more Hungarian of the two seeds, but if you are more familiar with cumin now, stick with it.  Komeny mag refers to Caraway, though it sounds more like cumin, I agree.  And in this dish, it makes more sense to use cumin.  For potatoes or cauliflauer, stick to caraway, as it brings out a subtle sweet flavor. For Hungarian guests, leave the cumin out and brown the meat very well so there is a lot of Malliard reaction and then you will have a rich liquid.  Hungarian food is deceptively simple, but requires a lot of technique. It seems like it would be &quot;too simple&quot; or needs more ingredients.  But if you do it right, it doesn&#039;t, and is more heavenly because of the simplicity.",

      "Review": "I love, love, love the simplicity of this cake. It was so easy to make yet the final results were a moist, rich, and very dense chocolate cake with a hint of coffee. I was not able to find  a cake mix without pudding in it at the market in town, so my cake might have turned out a bit denser then normal. I did not have semi-sweet chocolate chips, so I subbed 60% bitter sweet chocolate chips. I then topped the cake with a dusting of powdered sugar, a few white chocolate chips and thin strips of candied orange peel. I already have a few requesting this cake for their birthday cake this year. Thanks for posting this tasty recipe Melissa. Made and reviewed for the Newest Zaar Tag (winter 2011)",

I dusted this with some confectioner's sugar and served it with some fresh whipped cream.  Delicious!",

Smoked paprika is strong but gives a kind of barbeque flavor. If I do these again, I may try adding dry ranch dressing mix to tone them down a bit. I'll give a 1/2 star more for it being a non-fried, dry rub recipes as opposed to wet ones.",

Instead of all white flour, I added 1 and 1/2 cups of white flour and 1 cup of wheat flour. Also, to make them lighter, I experimented a little and finally found a great way to make them lighter. I added 1 tablespoon of the melted butter to the flour little at a time while mixing and warmed the buttermilk to room temperature. It was amazingly light and fluffy and they don't fall apart either!",

Substitute the agave nectar if possible :-)  I eat a vegan diet and prefer grade B maple syrup or dates (I soak them in a little bit of water or coconut water to make them the consistency of nectar).  Both maple syrup and dates are more nutrient dense than agave nectar.  Even though agave nectar has a low glycemic index, it has a high fructose content, which makes it hard for your body to metabolize.  Anyway, try maple syrup or dates instead, they are both tasty and healthier alternatives to agave nectar!",

      "Review": "I have been making your recipe for two years now. I've lost count of the number of batches that I've made - this is now the GoTo treat recipe in our house. (I'm estimating it somewhere in the double digits.) There are two reasons I love this recipe: one, it tastes fantastic. Two: I often make these for my students who are on any number of dietary restrictions, and I love how it covers so many bases. (Gluten free? check. Can't have dairy? use almond milk. Peanut butter? use almond butter. ) I get rave reviews from everyone (on restrictions or not) every time - the combination of honey, chocolate, peanut butter is just fantastic. For that reason I never substitute out the honey, which makes this a non-vegan item. Someday I will try a small batch with agave nectar and see if that does the same for me. If so, then bam, I'll have the vegan version too. But if it's not as good, then it has to be honey. Once I didn't have oil so I used butter. It tasted great that time too. I do make one tweak: I only use 5 cups of oats. I found that with 6 it was a tiny bit dry for my taste. I shared this recipe with someone else and they found that to be true as well so we both use only 5 cups now.",
